                        <p>I conducted <b>10 physical tests</b> using simple, low-cost, stationery materials. The tests included: a game for friends to learn about each other, tracking your progress on a hike, and a football-data activity kit for children. The focus was <b>qualitative user research</b> through observation, interviews and participatory design. </p>
                        <p>The feedback confirmed that implementing <b>gamification techniques</b> improved the overall user experience. Participants loved sharing their viewpoints so I incorporated <b>opinion-based questions</b> into the tests. </p>
                        <p>We also noted that <b>users needed an incentive</b> to learn. So, instead of forcing educational content into a game, the first prototype became a digital<b> workshop</b> that through “games” teached basic data concepts. </p>

I identified a need in the market: a <b>simple, interactive course</b> designed for people who will need to work with data. For example <b>high school</b> or <b>college students</b> and <b>professionals</b> wanting to improve their CV. <br><br>The workshop was first developed in <b>english as an online prototype</b> that used miro boards to mimic moving physical objects. The workshop was then <b>tested in a physical context</b> creating a simple prototype.<br><br>The next step was marketing the workshop. I expanded the brand sketches into a <b>style guide</b> for all materials, including the UI for the workshop activities. We also created an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dilo_with_data/"><b>instragam</b> account</a> focused on data literacy and prepared a slide deck to present the project to potential clients. <br><br>Finally, to promote the workshop, we set up and <b>Evenbrite account to legitimize transactions</b> with our clients and we promoted the course<b> through social media.</b></p>

                         <p>This project was amazing. I grew a lot as a designer and as a team leader. I placed special care in the <b>project’s documentation</b> since the team worked <b>asynchronously</b> in different <b>time zones</b> and in <b>languages</b>. Most of all I loved interacting with people to improve the project.  I also experience how rewarding creating educational content can be. Seeing people’s faces light up when they understand a new concept was very special and I am looking forward to people benefiting from our work. </p>
