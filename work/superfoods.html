                            <b>Superfoods</b> have been in vogue in

                            <b>dense</b> options for their diet. But,
                            where do superfoods come from? Although they seem to
                            have appeared overnight, many superfoods have an

                        <p >
                            During my research I noticed a common
                            <b>pattern</b>; due to their cultural
                            significance, several indigenous foods were banned
                            during colonization. Initially, I planned to explore
                            3 superfoods—<b
                                >amaranth, chia seeds, and spirulina</b
                            >—but the narrative felt too broad and scattered.
                        </p>
                        <p >
                            I decided to focus on <b>chia seeds</b>.
                            Their dramatic history, from a vital role in ancient
                            Mesoamerican cultures, then being banned and
                            forgotten after colonization, and finally their
                            modern revival, offered a compelling story.
                        </p>
                        <p >
                            To shape the project, I curated detailed research on
                            ancient diets, nutritional information, and modern
                            food markets. I also tested various visualization
                            techniques, including

                            My main goal was to share this story with as many
                            people as possible. I decided to write an<b>
                                online article</b>

                            that would be easy to <b>access</b> and
                            <b>share</b>. The journey of chia seeds
                            felt incredibly dramatic, and I wanted more people
                            to feel the weight that they were lost for hundreds
                            of years. For this, I conceptualized a
                            <b>short video game</b> where users could
                            <b>experience</b> the journey of chia
                            seeds firsthand.

                            With these goals in mind, I explored various ways to
                            present the story, ultimately choosing
                            <b>pixel art</b> as the ideal style. I
                            wanted to convey the concept of small pieces coming
                            together—just like chia seeds—and symbolize the idea
                            of building something larger.

                            I wanted the article to feel cohesive and fully
                            embrace the video game theme—from the visualizations
                            to the fonts. Every detail needed to be
                            <b>fun</b> and <b>lively</b>, so
                            I planned to <b>visualize</b> key

                            design <b>charts</b> to represent

                            the story to life, I focused on the details. I also
                            created short <b>animated</b>
                            <b>loops</b> and
                            <b>illustrations</b> that anthropomorphize
                            different foods, which would help guide users
                            through the narrative in an engaging way.

                            of food and culture by simply scrolling. So, after
                            organizing my research, I wrote an article that
                            started with <b>introduction</b> to
                            <b>superfoods</b> and their origin as a
                            marketing term. Then I highlighted various foods
                            with indigenous origins to then focus on chia seeds.

                            to have interesting elements for each paragraph. I
                            developed all the <b>illustrations</b>,
                            <b>animations</b>, and
                            <b>front-end code</b> for the website,

                            For the video game component, I
                            <b>collaborated</b> with a

                            While I conceptualized the gameplay and created the
                            visuals, the programmer handled game mechanics, and
                            the composer developed a soundtrack that enhanced

                            I’ve always loved <b>video games</b> as a
                            medium for <b>storytelling</b>. The player
                            becomes the protagonist as they experience the story
                            firsthand. In the case of Superfood Story, the

                            narrative, allowing them to connect with the content
                            in a new way. <br /><br />The game was split into
                            four key chapters:

                            <b>Food</b> is so essential that we often
                            overlook its complexity. This project was a journey
                            of discovery—not just about chia seeds, but about
                            food itself and the deep cultural connections it
                            carries. To tell this story the way I envisioned, I
                            had to push myself to grow as a
                            <b>designer, storyteller, </b>and<b>
                                developer. The entire process reinforced how
                            <b>powerful design</b> can be in making
                            <b>complex topics engaging</b> and
                            <b>accessible</b>, and how keeping

                            to more impactful designs.

                            And while this project is not perfect, I worked hard
                            to <b>pay my respects</b> to a tiny seed
                            and <b>learn new skills</b>. The story of
                            <b>chia seeds</b> is inspiring; full of
                            <b>ups and downs</b>, but ultimately, it’s
                            a story of <b>survival</b>.
