                        <p>
                            At the start of 2024, Freeletics set its north star:
                            <em>a fitness trainer in your pocket.</em> The
                            challenge for the product team was clear—how could
                            we leverage our app and emerging technologies to
                            bring this vision to life? Enter <b>LLMs </b>(Large
                            Language Model) and <b>AI </b>(Artificial
                            Intelligence), powerful tools that could help users
                            get reliable answers to their fitness and product
                            questions, emulating the experience of having a
                            personal coach available 24/7.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the content designer—and the product content
                            expert—I was entrusted with leading the content
                            strategy to train <em>Coach+</em>, Freeletics'
                            <b>Generative AI</b> assistant. With a short
                            timeline before launch and vast amounts of data in
                            multiple formats and languages, we needed a
                            <b>content strategy</b> that was both
                            <b>efficient</b> and <b>adaptable</b>. I took the
                            lead in structuring and refining the model’s
                            responses so they were not only technically accurate
                            but also helpful and aligned with our <b>brand</b>
                            <b>voice</b>.

                        <h4>🔎 Scope</h4>
                        <p>
                            The first step was understanding how LLMs work and
                            defining the essential topics for the initial
                            release. This required identifying what information
                            the model already had and what was missing. I worked
                            closely with <b>developers</b>, <b>engineers</b>,
                            <b>data</b> <b>scientists</b> and the
                            <b>product</b> <b>team</b> to align
                            <b>technical</b> <b>feasibility</b> with content
                            needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The product team had strategically placed
                            <em>Coach+</em> within the app where it could have
                            the highest impact. With these use cases mind, I
                            mapped out the <b>content</b> <b>needs</b> to
                            establish priorities, grouping the information in
                            two main categories:
                            <b>general fitness information</b> and
                            <b>product-specific content</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next, I broke down these broad categories into
                            <b>manageable</b> <b>deliverables</b> to maintain
                            focus and meet required deadlines. At the same time,
                            I developed a general quality framework to set clear
                            response standards and make sure users would receive
                            the best content possible. <br /><br />To support
                            scalability, I established a clear
                            <b>information</b> <b>hierarchy</b> and created a
                            <b>product</b> <b>concept</b> <b>map</b> that
                            organized content in a way that made it easy to
                            update with new information and integrate future
                            features seamlessly.

                            Training an LLM involves <b>two</b> key
                            <b>components</b>: the <em>preprompt</em>—a set of
                            instructions that define how the assistant should
                            behave—and the <em>custom corpus</em>—a curated
                            repository of knowledge it draws from to provide
                            answers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the <b>preprompt</b>, we drafted a directive
                            that would provide information in a positive and
                            informative tone. For the <b>custom</b>
                            <b>corpus</b>, I started by defining the scope of
                            <b>fitness</b> <b>knowledge</b> needed. The first
                            step was collecting common fitness-related questions
                            users ask online to identify trends and create a
                            list of <b>high</b>-<b>priority</b> <b>topics</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With these insights, I <b>curated</b> relevant
                            <b>articles</b> from the Freeletics <b>blog</b>,
                            selecting content that aligned with our goals and
                            feeding it into the LLM. For the <b>most</b>
                            <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> <b>topics</b>, I
                            crafted dedicated articles that provided clear,
                            actionable advice tailored to our brand voice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the <b>product</b> side, I conducted a
                            comprehensive <b>audit</b> of the <b>app</b>,
                            breaking down its <b>features</b> and
                            <b>sections</b> to identify potential areas where
                            users might need guidance. I then
                            <b>categorized</b> and <b>prioritized</b> these
                            topics based on their importance to new users. This
                            structured approach allowed me to set clear
                            milestones for the initial release while allocating
                            enough time for quality testing and refinement.

                        <p>
                            Refining the LLM was an ongoing process that
                            involved multiple rounds of testing and iteration.
                            To establish a clear evaluation framework, I
                            collaborated with the QA engineer to
                            <b>develop</b> a <b>rubric</b> that defined key
                            criteria for assessing the LLM’s responses. Using
                            this <b>framework</b>, I conducted an initial round
                            of <b>internal</b> <b>testing</b>. Once satisfactory
                            results were achieved, testing was expanded to a
                            subset of internal users to further
                            <b>refine</b> the <b>model</b> before finally
                            releasing to 100% of english speaking users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the app is available in several languages,
                            documentation and preprompt improvements were also
                            made to prepare the model for <b>multilingual</b>
                            <b>deployment</b>. This included breaking down
                            information into smaller tokens and incorporating
                            <b>language</b> <b>specifications</b> to handle
                            localized names. During this phase, I supervised and
                            trained an intern who took over the QA process,
                            helping him refine his data reporting,
                            documentation, and presentation skills. This allowed
                            me to focus on <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> and
                            <b>stakeholder</b> <b>reporting</b>. <br /><br />By
                            identifying recurring questions, we uncovered key
                            <b>user</b> <b>pain</b> <b>points</b>, which in turn
                            helped inform <b>product</b> <b>decisions</b> and
                            shape future development efforts.

                            company as a whole. Leading this initiative has been
                            an incredibly fulfilling experience. It’s not
                            perfect but I’m proud of how far we’ve come and
                            excited to see how it continues to evolve.
