                        <p>
                            At the start of 2024, Freeletics set a new north
                            star:
                            <em>build a fitness trainer in your pocket</em>. To
                            support this vision, the product team began
                            exploring how to integrate <b>Generative AI</b> into
                            the app experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After reviewing several use cases, we saw a clear
                            opportunity: many users had recurring
                            <b>questions about the product itself</b>. So we
                            decided to build an <b>AI fitness assistant</b>‚Äîa
                            chat-based experience where users could ask
                            questions in <b>natural language</b> and get
                            real-time answers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This project was assigned to me. As the content
                            designer and product content expert, I led the
                            <b>content strategy</b> for training the assistant.
                            I started by researching <b>LLM technology</b>,
                            mapping content gaps, and aligning with

                            to ensure the answers were accurate, on-brand, and
                            technically feasible.

                        <p>
                            The product team strategically placed
                            <em>Coach+</em> within the app to maximize impact.
                            With these use cases in mind, I mapped out the
                            <b>content</b> <b>needs</b> to establish priorities,
                            grouping information into two main categories:

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then broke down these broad categories into
                            <b>manageable</b> <b>deliverables</b> to maintain

                            developed a quality framework to set clear response
                            standards, ensuring users would receive the best
                            content possible.<br /><br />
                            To support scalability, I established a clear

                            Training an LLM involves <b>two</b> key
                            <b>components</b>: the
                            <em>preprompt</em>‚Äîinstructions defining the
                            assistant‚Äôs behavior‚Äîand the

                            assistant draws from to answer queries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the <b>preprompt</b>, we drafted a directive to
                            ensure responses were positive and informative. For
                            the <b>custom</b> <b>corpus</b>, I defined the scope
                            of <b>fitness</b> <b>knowledge</b> required,
                            starting by collecting common fitness questions
                            users ask online to identify trends and build a list
                            of <b>high</b>-<b>priority</b> <b>topics</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using these insights, I <b>curated</b> relevant
                            <b>articles</b> from the Freeletics <b>blog</b>,
                            selecting content aligned with our goals and feeding
                            it into the LLM. For the <b>most</b>
                            <b>frequently</b> <b>asked</b> <b>topics</b>, I
                            wrote dedicated articles providing clear, actionable
                            advice in our brand voice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the <b>product</b> side, I conducted a
                            comprehensive <b>audit</b> of the <b>app</b>,
                            breaking down its <b>features</b> and
                            <b>sections</b> to identify areas where users might
                            need guidance. I then <b>categorized</b> and
                            <b>prioritized</b> these topics based on their
                            importance to new users. This structured approach
                            allowed me to set clear milestones for the initial
                            release, leaving time for quality testing and
                            refinement.

                            Refining the LLM was an iterative process that
                            required continuous <b>testing</b> and
                            <b>optimization</b>. To guide this, I collaborated
                            with our QA engineer to <b>develop</b> a custom
                            <b>rubric</b>‚Äîa clear
                            <b>evaluation framework</b> for assessing response
                            quality. I then ran an initial round of
                            <b>internal testing</b>, using this rubric to
                            pinpoint weak areas and <b>improve</b> the content
                            based on <b>user feedback</b> and question

                        <p>
                            Once we reached a stable baseline, I expanded
                            testing to a group of internal users for further
                            <b>refinement</b>, before releasing Coach+ to 100%
                            of <b>English-speaking</b> users.

                            I led the <b>content strategy</b> from the ground
                            up, creating a <b>flexible framework</b> that made
                            training the LLM faster and more efficient. I built
                            a <b>QA rubric and review process</b> to ensure
                            responses were accurate, human-sounding, and
                            personalized. I also created a detailed
                            <b>product concept map</b> and structured the
                            <b>information architecture</b> to support
                            scalability. In parallel, I prepared the setup for a
                            <b>multi-language release</b> and delivered clear
                            <b>data and performance reports</b> to stakeholders.

                            On a personal level, this was one of the most
                            intense <b>learning journeys</b> of my career. I
                            went from a basic understanding of LLMs to being
                            deeply involved in their
                            <b>practical application</b>. What started as an
                            overwhelming challenge evolved into a
                            <b>structured and functioning feature</b>, thanks to
                            close collaboration with a dedicated team.

                            I also had the opportunity to
                            <b>mentor an intern</b> throughout the project,
                            helping them grow their skills in
                            <b>documentation</b>, <b>data analysis</b>, and
                            <b>presenting insights</b>. This experience
                            reinforced the importance of
                            <b>clear communication</b>‚Äîboth for machines and the
                            people building them. I‚Äôm proud of the
                            <b>foundation we built</b> and excited to see how
                            this feature evolves over time.
