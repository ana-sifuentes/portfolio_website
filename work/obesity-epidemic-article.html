                        <h4>💬 Introduction</h4>
                        <p>
                            This project originated as a
                            <b>research study</b> on
                            <b>Brazil's obesity epidemic</b> and the increasing
                            prevalence of noncommunicable diseases—a growing
                            public health concern.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our challenge was twofold: to create a tool enabling
                            stakeholders to access data effectively while
                            simplifying the complexity of the obesity crisis for
                            the general public.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To address this, we collaborated with the research
                            team to transform the <b>paper</b> into an
                            accessible <b>website</b>. By developing a clear
                            narrative, we guided users through extensive
                            information in an intuitive way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this project, I contributed by
                            <b>designing engaging visuals</b> and
                            <b>supporting front-end development</b> to ensure a
                            user-friendly experience.

                            <b>⚠️ Considerations</b><br />Diverse audiences with
                            varying levels of expertise, complexity of the

                        <h4>🔎 Research</h4>
                        <p>
                            We worked very closely with the client to
                            <b>learn</b> how to talk about <b>health</b> and
                            <b>obesity</b>. Through card sorting exercises, we
                            managed to <b>define</b> the <b>story</b> and
                            <b>visuals</b> for the project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Simplicity</b> was our guiding principle
                            throughout the project. We had to be very mindful of
                            the <b>time</b> constraints and the team’s
                            <b>abilities</b>, all while working
                            <b>remotely</b> across 3 different time zones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We gathered lots of sources of <b>inspiration</b> to
                            define what the team could do—from
                            <b>websites</b> to <b>illustrations</b>, from
                            government <b>guidelines</b> to <b>reports</b>. We
                            also used Brazilian artists as reference to reflect
                            that this was a Brazilian research study intended
                            for a Brazilian audience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After analyzing our options, we chose a
                            <b>"scrollytelling"</b> approach for the website.
                            This format allowed us to craft a
                            <b>visually engaging story</b> about the epidemic
                            while offering <b>straightforward navigation</b> for
                            stakeholders to access data directly.

                        <p>
                            The goal was to develop a style that felt friendly,
                            inviting, and distinctly unique. I focused on
                            <b>abstract shapes</b> and <b>bright colors</b> to
                            reflect the diversity of Brazil’s population. Rather
                            than using rounded shapes, which felt overly common,
                            we explored irregular, asymmetric edges to create
                            dynamic and vibrant visuals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We experimented with color combinations and
                            <b>physical textures</b> to give the design a
                            tangible, <b>handcrafted feel</b>. To represent
                            people, I conceptualized two approaches:
                            <b>detailed illustrations</b> for
                            <b>individuals</b> and <b>simplified shapes</b> to
                            depict <b>groups</b>. This dual style ensured
                            clarity while adding depth to the visuals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To make the website as engaging as possible, we
                            <b>integrated</b> <b>visuals</b> into the
                            <b>UI</b> itself, using <b>illustrations</b> as
                            functional and aesthetic elements. The team also
                            advised against incorporating the colors of the
                            Brazilian flag in clothing illustrations, as it
                            could unintentionally suggest political bias—a blind
                            spot they kindly brought to my attention as the only
                            non-Brazilian on the project.

                            The <b>color palette</b> was carefully selected to
                            enhance <b>data visualizations</b>. Summarizing
                            large amounts of data in a single image required
                            strong contrast to ensure the audience could easily
                            differentiate between variables.

                            To reinforce the project’s identity, I incorporated
                            branding elements into even the simplest graphs. For
                            instance, to <b>illustrate</b> obesity
                            <b>prevalence</b> in the USA, I added a silhouette
                            of the country with an upward-pointing arrow that
                            <b>mirrored</b> the <b>data trend</b>. These small
                            illustrative details in graph titles provided
                            readers with a quick, visual summary of the
                            information.

To address this, I developed a concept using <b>abstract shapes</b> to represent <b>100 individuals</b>, with <b>color coding</b> to show how obesity prevalence increased over time. This design allowed users to quickly understand the <b>severity of the issue</b> and frame it as a <b>major public health concern</b>.</p>
