                            <b>nutrition, cost, and convenience</b>. Many people
                            repeat the same meals or rely on expensive, less
                            healthy options.

                            the idea into an <b>app prototype</b> designed in
                            Figma, featuring recipe browsing and pantry
                            tracking.

                        <p>
                            Stocking a <b>pantry from scratch</b> can be
                            overwhelming‚Äîespecially after moving to a new
                            country. I began writing <b>ingredient lists</b> by
                            food category to understand what to prioritize, how
                            to cook with unfamiliar items, and which options
                            were <b>more affordable</b> while still supporting a
                            <b>balanced diet</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Supermarket visits became research sessions: I
                            observed which <b>regional vegetables</b> were
                            consistently available and inexpensive, then shaped
                            my pantry list around them. This process made me
                            realize that <b>‚Äúwhat should I cook today?‚Äù</b>
                            is a universal question‚Äîregardless of country,
                            budget, or experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These reflections led to the idea of an app that
                            could <b>suggest recipes</b> based on what users
                            already have‚Äîespecially ingredients that are about
                            to expire. What if instead of asking ‚Äúwhat do I want
                            to eat?‚Äù, the app could help answer
                            <b>‚Äúwhat can I cook today with what I have?‚Äù</b>

                        <p>
                            One of my key motivations for this project was to
                            <b>maximize resources</b> and
                            <b>minimize food waste</b>. The concept also aligned
                            with my personal values of
                            <b>sustainability and nutrition</b>, which led me to
                            focus primarily on
                            <b>pescatarian and vegetarian recipes</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To build a strong foundation, I defined clear
                            <b>recipe guidelines</b>: each meal would center
                            around one <b>core protein</b>and combine
                            <b>fresh, seasonal produce</b> with
                            <b>shelf-stable ingredients</b> to ensure both
                            <b>nutritional density</b> and <b>affordability</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I selected <b>10 recipes</b> from my personal
                            rotation and structured them by limiting myself to
                            <b>5 proteins</b>‚Äîcreating
                            <b>2 dishes per protein</b>. I wrote down the
                            recipes while cooking, testing them in real time and
                            refining both flavor and structure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <b>app idea came later</b>, so I scoped a
                            focused <b>MVP prototype</b> for this phase. It
                            featured two core functionalities: the ability to
                            <b>cook a recipe step-by-step</b> and
                            <b>stock a pantry</b>‚Äîa minimal version of the
                            broader system I envisioned.

                        <p>
                            For inspiration, I explored
                            <b>meal prep videos</b> on YouTube, nutritional
                            rankings of vegetables, and <b>food databases</b> to

                            affordable, nutrient-dense combinations.

                        <p>
                            Visually, I drew inspiration from
                            <b>food packaging and illustration styles</b>. I
                            wanted the cards to feel <b>bold and vibrant</b>, so
                            I referenced <b>Mexican design</b>,
                            <b>playful Japanese illustrations</b>, and the
                            color-rich aesthetics of
                            <b>Portuguese sardine cans</b>. These helped shape
                            the <b>color palette</b> and visual tone of the

                            One side of each card was designed to be highly

                            creating a quick, appetizing entry point into the

                        <p>
                            The goal for the recipe cards was to create a design
                            that was both <b>practical</b> and
                            <b>visually engaging</b>. I aimed for a
                            <b>compact format</b> that could easily fit on top
                            of the fridge, making it convenient for daily use,
                            while <b>bold, lively colors</b> ensured it would
                            stand out in any kitchen.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Early on, I chose to use
                            <b>illustrations instead of photography</b>. This
                            decision allowed for
                            <b>visual consistency</b> across all recipes, the
                            <b>flexibility to reuse assets</b>, and avoided the
                            complications of food photography‚Äîespecially in a
                            personal project with limited resources.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I tested different formats and from initial
                            <b>digital sketches </b> I created a
                            <b>color palette</b> that worked as part of the
                            project‚Äôs design constraints. These foundational
                            choices helped shape a clear
                            <b>brand identity</b> early on, and later made it
                            easier to <b>scale the design</b> into a digital
                            product during the app prototype phase.

                            I began by <b>cleaning up initial sketches</b> from
                            Procreate and turning them into
                            <b>vector illustrations</b> in Figma. I also used
                            the nutritional information I collected to include
                            macros for each recipe. As I translated the recipe
                            cards into digital format, the idea for an
                            <b>app prototype</b> started to take shape. Reusing
                            the assets I had already created made it easier to
                            <b>bridge the transition from print to screen</b>
                            while maintaining visual consistency.

                            The <b>Tamagoyaki card</b> was the first recipe I
                            sketched and finalized‚Äîa

                            To make the most of the <b>limited space</b>, I took
                            a <b>playful approach to typography</b>, letting the
                            text flow naturally rather than sticking to strict
                            alignment. I even reused the

                            I started by outlining a <b>simple user flow</b>:
                            what would users want to do when opening the app?
                            For this MVP, I focused on two core actions‚Äî<b
                                >stocking the pantry</b
                            >
                            and <b>cooking a recipe</b>.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <p>
                            Based on that flow, I
                            <b>sketched the screens</b> and defined the key UI
                            elements each would need. From there, I developed
                            <b>low-fidelity wireframes</b> and consulted with
                            developer friends to ensure the designs were

                            That first round of feedback helped me
                            <b>refine button placement</b> and consider how the
                            app could scale in the future. To avoid increasing

                            Once the core screens were designed and aligned with
                            the visual system, I built an
                            <b>interactive prototype</b> in Figma to simulate
                            the key flows of the app. This included both the
                            <b>pantry management</b> and
                            <b>step-by-step cooking</b> experiences, ensuring

                            goal at this stage was to validate core assumptions
                            through a <b>small round of user testing</b>. I
                            focused on identifying potential usability issues,

                            whether the concept could scale into a full product.

                            I tested the app prototype with both users familiar

                            and followed up with a short survey. The feedback
