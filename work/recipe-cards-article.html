                            Deciding what to cook every day can be
                            overwhelming‚Äîespecially when balancing
                            <b>nutrition, cost, and convenience</b>. Many people
                            repeat the same meals or rely on expensive, less
                            healthy options.

                            the idea into an <b>app prototype</b> designed in
                            Figma, featuring recipe browsing and pantry
                            tracking.

                        <p>
                            Stocking a <b>pantry from scratch</b> can be
                            overwhelming‚Äîespecially after moving to a new
                            country. I began writing <b>ingredient lists</b> by
                            food category to understand what to prioritize, how
                            to cook with unfamiliar items, and which options
                            were <b>more affordable</b> while still supporting a
                            <b>balanced diet</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Supermarket visits became research sessions: I
                            observed which <b>regional vegetables</b> were
                            consistently available and inexpensive, then shaped
                            my pantry list around them. This process made me
                            realize that <b>‚Äúwhat should I cook today?‚Äù</b>
                            is a universal question‚Äîregardless of country,
                            budget, or experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These reflections led to the idea of an app that
                            could <b>suggest recipes</b> based on what users
                            already have‚Äîespecially ingredients that are about
                            to expire. What if instead of asking ‚Äúwhat do I want
                            to eat?‚Äù, the app could help answer
                            <b>‚Äúwhat can I cook today with what I have?‚Äù</b>

                        <h4>üîé Research</h4>
                        <p>
                            One of my key motivations for this project was to
                            <b>maximize</b> <b>resources</b> and
                            <b>minimize</b> <b>food</b> <b>waste</b>. The
                            project also aligned with my personal values of
                            <b>sustainability</b> and <b>nutrition</b>, leading
                            me to focus on primarily <b>pescatarian</b> and
                            <b>vegetarian</b> recipes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To create a solid foundation for the recipes, I
                            established clear guidelines: each meal would
                            <b>balance</b> <b>fresh</b>, seasonal
                            <b>produce</b> with <b>shelf-stable</b>
                            <b>canned</b> <b>goods</b> to ensure nutritional
                            density and affordability. For inspiration, I
                            watched YouTube videos on meal prep strategies and
                            <b>nutritional</b> <b>rankings</b> of
                            <b>vegetables</b>, and consulting <b>food</b>
                            <b>databases</b> to compare ingredient profiles. I
                            had recently moved to a new country so supermarket
                            visits became an opportunity to observe which
                            regional vegetables were the <b>most</b>
                            <b>affordable</b> and could be used to shape the
                            <b>ingredient</b> <b>list</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With my research in hand, I began planning and
                            testing recipes, drawing inspiration from my
                            <b>favorite</b> <b>dishes</b> while refining them
                            based on <b>ingredient</b> <b>availability</b> and

                        <p>
                            The goal for the recipe cards was to create a design
                            that was both <b>practical</b> and <b>visually</b>
                            <b>engaging</b>. I aimed for a compact format that
                            could easily fit on top of the fridge, making it
                            convenient for daily use, while <b>bold</b>, lively
                            <b>colors</b> ensured it would stand out. Early on,
                            I decided to use <b>illustrations</b> instead of
                            photography. This allowed for
                            <b>consistency</b> across all recipes, the
                            <b>flexibility</b> to reuse assets, and
                            <b>avoided</b> the <b>complexities</b> of food
                            photography.

                            Leveraging the assets I had already created, I began
                            sketching ideas for an app that would complement the
                            physical cards. The <b>app</b>
                            <b>concept</b> evolved to include
                            <b>features</b> such as tracking <b>nutritional</b>
                            <b>intake</b>, <b>pantry</b> <b>management</b>, and
                            automated <b>meal</b> <b>suggestions</b> based on
                            available ingredients.

                            The tamagoyaki card was the first recipe I sketched
                            and finalized‚Äîa Japanese rolled omelette that‚Äôs
                            simple in flavor but challenging in technique. This
                            recipe became the <b>testing</b> ground for
                            <b>experimenting</b> with <b>layout</b> and
                            <b>design</b> decisions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To make the most of the <b>limited</b> <b>space</b>,
                            I embraced a <b>playful</b> approach to
                            <b>typography</b>, allowing the text to flow rather
                            than sticking to rigid lines. I reused the egg
                            element as a letter, adding a touch of
                            <b>fun</b> and making the design feel <b>unique</b>.
                            This process helped establish a creative and
                            engaging style that <b>set</b> the <b>tone</b> for
                            the rest of the recipe cards.

                        <p>
                            To bring the concept to life, I started by designing
                            several <b>app</b> <b>screens</b> and
                            <b>collaborating</b> with a <b>software</b>
                            <b>engineer</b> to develop a potential <b>app</b>
                            <b>pitch</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The app was envisioned as a <b>companion</b> to the
                            <b>recipe</b> <b>cards</b>, combining the benefits
                            of a <b>physical</b> reminder with the digital
                            advantages of <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b>. It aimed
                            to help users cook simple, nutritious meals.
                            Features like calorie and macro tracking positioned
                            the app as a <b>comprehensive</b> food and
                            <b>nutrition</b> <b>tool</b>. To tackle <b>food</b>
                            <b>waste</b>, the app would include
                            <b>reminders</b> for when pantry items were nearing
                            their expiration date and recipe
                            <b>suggestions</b> designed to use up ingredients
                            already on hand.

                        <p>
                            Alongside the app, I <b>printed</b> the first
                            <b>batch</b> of recipe cards and distributed them to
                            10 close friends for initial testing. Feedback from
                            this <b>testing</b> <b>phase</b> highlighted the
                            <b>practicality</b> of the <b>cards</b>, with the

                            The tone of the content played a key role in
                            bringing the recipe cards and app to life. For the
                            <b>recipe</b> <b>cards</b>, I adopted a
                            <b>short</b> and <b>direct</b> writing style. Each
                            recipe included pairing suggestions to
                            <b>encourage</b> meal <b>creativity</b>, and every
                            set of instructions ended with a simple: ‚ÄúEnjoy.‚Äù
                            This touch reinforced the idea that cooking should
                            be both <b>practical</b> and <b>pleasurable</b>.

                        <p>
                            For the <b>app</b>, I extended this approach by
                            referring to every user as ‚ÄúChef.‚Äù This decision
                            served a dual purpose: to <b>empower</b>
