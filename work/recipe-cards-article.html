                            <b>nutrition, cost, and convenience</b>. Many people
                            repeat the same meals or rely on expensive, less
                            healthy options.

                            the idea into an <b>app prototype</b> designed in
                            Figma, featuring recipe browsing and pantry
                            tracking.

                        <p>
                            Stocking a <b>pantry from scratch</b> can be
                            overwhelming‚Äîespecially after moving to a new
                            country. I began writing <b>ingredient lists</b> by
                            food category to understand what to prioritize, how
                            to cook with unfamiliar items, and which options
                            were <b>more affordable</b> while still supporting a
                            <b>balanced diet</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Supermarket visits became research sessions: I
                            observed which <b>regional vegetables</b> were
                            consistently available and inexpensive, then shaped
                            my pantry list around them. This process made me
                            realize that <b>‚Äúwhat should I cook today?‚Äù</b>
                            is a universal question‚Äîregardless of country,
                            budget, or experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These reflections led to the idea of an app that
                            could <b>suggest recipes</b> based on what users
                            already have‚Äîespecially ingredients that are about
                            to expire. What if instead of asking ‚Äúwhat do I want
                            to eat?‚Äù, the app could help answer
                            <b>‚Äúwhat can I cook today with what I have?‚Äù</b>

                        <p>
                            One of my key motivations for this project was to
                            <b>maximize resources</b> and
                            <b>minimize food waste</b>. The concept also aligned
                            with my personal values of
                            <b>sustainability and nutrition</b>, which led me to
                            focus primarily on
                            <b>pescatarian and vegetarian recipes</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To build a strong foundation, I defined clear
                            <b>recipe guidelines</b>: each meal would center
                            around one <b>core protein</b>and combine
                            <b>fresh, seasonal produce</b> with
                            <b>shelf-stable ingredients</b> to ensure both
                            <b>nutritional density</b> and <b>affordability</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I selected <b>10 recipes</b> from my personal
                            rotation and structured them by limiting myself to
                            <b>5 proteins</b>‚Äîcreating
                            <b>2 dishes per protein</b>. I wrote down the
                            recipes while cooking, testing them in real time and
                            refining both flavor and structure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <b>app idea came later</b>, so I scoped a
                            focused <b>MVP prototype</b> for this phase. It
                            featured two core functionalities: the ability to
                            <b>cook a recipe step-by-step</b> and
                            <b>stock a pantry</b>‚Äîa minimal version of the
                            broader system I envisioned.

                        <p>
                            For inspiration, I explored
                            <b>meal prep videos</b> on YouTube, nutritional
                            rankings of vegetables, and <b>food databases</b> to

                        <p>
                            Visually, I drew inspiration from
                            <b>food packaging and illustration styles</b>. I
                            wanted the cards to feel <b>bold and vibrant</b>, so
                            I referenced <b>Mexican design</b>,
                            <b>playful Japanese illustrations</b>, and the
                            color-rich aesthetics of
                            <b>Portuguese sardine cans</b>. These helped shape
                            the <b>color palette</b> and visual tone of the
                            brand.

                        <p>
                            One side of each card was designed to be highly
                            <b>visual</b>, showcasing key ingredients and
                            creating a quick, appetizing entry point into the

                        <p>
                            The goal for the recipe cards was to create a design
                            that was both <b>practical</b> and
                            <b>visually engaging</b>. I aimed for a
                            <b>compact format</b> that could easily fit on top
                            of the fridge, making it convenient for daily use,
                            while <b>bold, lively colors</b> ensured it would
                            stand out in any kitchen.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Early on, I chose to use
                            <b>illustrations instead of photography</b>. This
                            decision allowed for
                            <b>visual consistency</b> across all recipes, the
                            <b>flexibility to reuse assets</b>, and avoided the
                            complications of food photography‚Äîespecially in a
                            personal project with limited resources.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I tested different formats and from initial
                            <b>digital sketches </b> I created a
                            <b>color palette</b> that worked as part of the
                            project‚Äôs design constraints. These foundational
                            choices helped shape a clear
                            <b>brand identity</b> early on, and later made it
                            easier to <b>scale the design</b> into a digital
                            product during the app prototype phase.

                            I began by <b>cleaning up initial sketches</b> from
                            Procreate and turning them into
                            <b>vector illustrations</b> in Figma. I also used
                            the nutritional information I collected to include
                            macros for each recipe. As I translated the recipe
                            cards into digital format, the idea for an
                            <b>app prototype</b> started to take shape. Reusing
                            the assets I had already created made it easier to
                            <b>bridge the transition from print to screen</b>
                            while maintaining visual consistency.

                            The <b>Tamagoyaki card</b> was the first recipe I
                            sketched and finalized‚Äîa
                            <b>Japanese rolled omelette</b> that‚Äôs simple in

                            became the testing ground for exploring layout and

                            To make the most of the <b>limited space</b>, I took
                            a <b>playful approach to typography</b>, letting the
                            text flow naturally rather than sticking to strict
                            alignment. I even reused the

                            visual twist that helped the card feel distinct.

                        <p>
                            The goal for the recipe cards was to create a design
                            that was both <b>practical</b> and <b>visually</b>
                            <b>engaging</b>. I aimed for a compact format that
                            could easily fit on top of the fridge, making it
                            convenient for daily use, while <b>bold</b>, lively
                            <b>colors</b> ensured it would stand out. Early on,
                            I decided to use <b>illustrations</b> instead of
                            photography. This allowed for
                            <b>consistency</b> across all recipes, the
                            <b>flexibility</b> to reuse assets, and
                            <b>avoided</b> the <b>complexities</b> of food
                            photography.

                        <p>
                            Leveraging the assets I had already created, I began
                            sketching ideas for an app that would complement the
                            physical cards. The <b>app</b>
                            <b>concept</b> evolved to include
                            <b>features</b> such as tracking <b>nutritional</b>
                            <b>intake</b>, <b>pantry</b> <b>management</b>, and
                            automated <b>meal</b> <b>suggestions</b> based on
                            available ingredients.

                            The tamagoyaki card was the first recipe I sketched
                            and finalized‚Äîa Japanese rolled omelette that‚Äôs
                            simple in flavor but challenging in technique. This
                            recipe became the <b>testing</b> ground for
                            <b>experimenting</b> with <b>layout</b> and
                            <b>design</b> decisions.

                        <p>
                            To make the most of the <b>limited</b> <b>space</b>,
                            I embraced a <b>playful</b> approach to
                            <b>typography</b>, allowing the text to flow rather
                            than sticking to rigid lines. I reused the egg
                            element as a letter, adding a touch of
                            <b>fun</b> and making the design feel <b>unique</b>.
                            This process helped establish a creative and
                            engaging style that <b>set</b> the <b>tone</b> for
                            the rest of the recipe cards.

                        <h4>‚úàÔ∏è Prototype</h4>
                        <p>
                            To bring the concept to life, I started by designing
                            several <b>app</b> <b>screens</b> and
                            <b>collaborating</b> with a <b>software</b>
                            <b>engineer</b> to develop a potential <b>app</b>
                            <b>pitch</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The app was envisioned as a <b>companion</b> to the
                            <b>recipe</b> <b>cards</b>, combining the benefits
                            of a <b>physical</b> reminder with the digital
                            advantages of <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b>. It aimed
                            to help users cook simple, nutritious meals.
                            Features like calorie and macro tracking positioned
                            the app as a <b>comprehensive</b> food and
                            <b>nutrition</b> <b>tool</b>. To tackle <b>food</b>
                            <b>waste</b>, the app would include
                            <b>reminders</b> for when pantry items were nearing
                            their expiration date and recipe
                            <b>suggestions</b> designed to use up ingredients
                            already on hand.

                        <p>
                            Alongside the app, I <b>printed</b> the first
                            <b>batch</b> of recipe cards and distributed them to
                            10 close friends for initial testing. Feedback from
                            this <b>testing</b> <b>phase</b> highlighted the
                            <b>practicality</b> of the <b>cards</b>, with the
                            ‚ÄúTuna Croqueta‚Äù recipe, an adaptation of a family

                            The tone of the content played a key role in
                            bringing the recipe cards and app to life. For the
                            <b>recipe</b> <b>cards</b>, I adopted a
                            <b>short</b> and <b>direct</b> writing style. Each
                            recipe included pairing suggestions to
                            <b>encourage</b> meal <b>creativity</b>, and every
                            set of instructions ended with a simple: ‚ÄúEnjoy.‚Äù
                            This touch reinforced the idea that cooking should
                            be both <b>practical</b> and <b>pleasurable</b>.

                            referring to every user as ‚ÄúChef.‚Äù This decision
                            served a dual purpose: to <b>empower</b>
                            <b>users</b> by framing them as capable cooks and to
                            add an <b>inclusive</b> <b>tone</b> when addressing
                            potential users.

                            This project was <b>crafted</b> with a lot of
                            <b>love</b>, and I hope that shows in all the little
                            details. I thoroughly enjoyed diving into the
                            research, creating visualizations, and learning more
                            about UI design. As a personal project, it brought
                            together <b>many</b> of my <b>talents</b> and
                            allowed me to <b>explore</b> <b>areas</b> I‚Äôm
                            <b>passionate</b> about, making it an incredibly
                            rewarding experience.

                            Working on <em>YOMI</em> made me <b>happy</b>, and
                            it‚Äôs inspired me to continue <b>developing</b> it
                            <b>further</b>. I see this project as a platform to
                            keep polishing my skills, explore new ideas, and
                            share something meaningful. I‚Äôm excited about what‚Äôs
                            next and where it can take me.
