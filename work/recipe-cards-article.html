                        <p >The challenge of deciding what to cook every day can be overwhelming, especially when trying to balance nutrition, cost, and convenience. This challenge inspired the idea for <em>YOMI</em>, a set of <b>recipe cards</b> with a simple, visual solution to provide balanced meal ideas. What started as a casual conversation soon evolved into a deeper exploration of how to create <b>nutritious</b>, <b>affordable</b>, and <b>shelf-stable</b> meals.</p><p > As the project grew, I expanded beyond physical recipe cards and began prototyping an <b>app concept</b> that would allow users to access recipes, track their meals, and manage their pantry with ease. For this personal project, I played on multiple roles—developing the <b>branding</b>, curating and designing the <b>recipe content</b>, calculating <b>nutritional values</b>, and creating the <b>app prototype</b> in Figma to bring the idea to life.</p>

                        <p >One of my key motivations for this project was to <b>maximize</b> <b>resources</b> and <b>minimize</b> <b>food</b> <b>waste</b>. The project also aligned with my personal values of <b>sustainability</b> and <b>nutrition</b>, leading me to focus on primarily <b>pescatarian</b> and <b>vegetarian</b> recipes.</p><p >To create a solid foundation for the recipes, I established clear guidelines: each meal would <b>balance</b> <b>fresh</b>, seasonal <b>produce</b> with <b>shelf-stable</b> <b>canned</b> <b>goods</b> to ensure nutritional density and affordability. For inspiration, I watched YouTube videos on meal prep strategies and <b>nutritional</b> <b>rankings</b> of <b>vegetables</b>, and consulting <b>food</b> <b>databases</b> to compare ingredient profiles. I had recently moved to a new country so supermarket visits became an opportunity to observe which regional vegetables were the <b>most</b> <b>affordable</b> and could be used to shape the <b>ingredient</b> <b>list</b>.</p><p >With my research in hand, I began planning and testing recipes, drawing inspiration from my <b>favorite</b> <b>dishes</b> while refining them based on <b>ingredient</b> <b>availability</b> and <b>nutritional</b> <b>value</b>.</p>

I aimed for a compact format that could easily fit on top of the fridge, making it convenient for daily use, while <b>bold</b>, lively <b>colors</b> ensured it would stand out. Early on, I decided to use <b>illustrations</b> instead of photography. This allowed for <b>consistency</b> across all recipes, the <b>flexibility</b> to reuse assets, and <b>avoided</b> the <b>complexities</b> of food photography.</p><p >Leveraging the assets I had already created, I began sketching ideas for an app that would complement the physical cards. The <b>app</b> <b>concept</b> evolved to include <b>features</b> such as tracking <b>nutritional</b> <b>intake</b>, <b>pantry</b> <b>management</b>, and automated <b>meal</b> <b>suggestions</b> based on available ingredients. </p>

I reused the egg element as a letter, adding a touch of <b>fun</b> and making the design feel <b>unique</b>. This process helped establish a creative and engaging style that <b>set</b> the <b>tone</b> for the rest of the recipe cards.</p>

                          <p >To bring the concept to life, I started by designing several <b>app</b> <b>screens</b> and <b>collaborating</b> with a <b>software</b> <b>engineer</b> to develop a potential <b>app</b> <b>pitch</b>. </p><p >The app was envisioned as a <b>companion</b> to the <b>recipe</b> <b>cards</b>, combining the benefits of a <b>physical</b> reminder with the digital advantages of <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b>. It aimed to help users cook simple, nutritious meals. Features like calorie and macro tracking positioned the app as a <b>comprehensive</b> food and <b>nutrition</b> <b>tool</b>. To tackle <b>food</b> <b>waste</b>, the app would include <b>reminders</b> for when pantry items were nearing their expiration date and recipe <b>suggestions</b> designed to use up ingredients already on hand. </p><p >Alongside the app, I <b>printed</b> the first <b>batch</b> of recipe cards and distributed them to 10 close friends for initial testing. Feedback from this <b>testing</b> <b>phase</b> highlighted the <b>practicality</b> of the <b>cards</b>, with the “Tuna Croqueta” recipe, an adaptation of a family favorite, becoming a regular part of their weekly meals.</p>

For the <b>recipe</b> <b>cards</b>, I adopted a <b>short</b> and <b>direct</b> writing style. Each recipe included pairing suggestions to <b>encourage</b> meal <b>creativity</b>, and every set of instructions ended with a simple: “Enjoy.” This touch reinforced the idea that cooking should be both <b>practical</b> and <b>pleasurable</b>.</p><p >For the <b>app</b>, I extended this approach by referring to every user as “Chef.” This decision served a dual purpose: to <b>empower</b> <b>users</b> by framing them as capable cooks and to add an <b>inclusive</b> <b>tone</b> when addressing potential users. </p>
