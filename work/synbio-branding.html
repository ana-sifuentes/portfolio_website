                        <h4>üí¨ Introduction</h4>
                        <p>
                            From 2013 to 2020, I worked at the
                            <b>iGEM Foundation</b>, the organization behind the
                            iGEM Competition, the <b>largest</b> <b>global</b>
                            <b>gathering</b> in <b>synthetic</b> <b>biology</b>,
                            bringing together thousands of scientists, students,
                            and academics in the fields of biology, biomedicine,
                            and sustainability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I joined iGEM as an intern, but being part of a
                            small team meant I quickly took on
                            <b>larger</b>
                            <b>responsibilities</b>. In 2014, as the foundation
                            prepared for its biggest event yet, the first ever
                            Giant Jamboree, I led the development of a
                            <b>new</b> <b>event</b> <b>brand</b> to make the
                            experience feel special. This laid the foundation
                            for a yearly <b>visual</b> <b>identity</b>
                            <b>system</b> that balanced uniqueness with
                            consistency, ensuring each competition felt distinct
                            while maintaining iGEM‚Äôs core values.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond branding, I was responsible for
                            <b>updating</b> the <b>website</b> and
                            <b>creating</b>
                            <b>materials</b> for participants and attendees.
                            This work spanned the entire year, culminating at
                            the major event each fall. Through this experience,
                            I helped shape the visual language of iGEM,
                            enhancing how the competition communicated its
                            mission to a growing global audience.

                            As the <b>sole</b> <b>designer</b> at iGEM, I took
                            on a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> of
                            <b>responsibilities</b>, allowing me to refine my
                            skills and learn on the go. While demanding at
                            times, this experience gave me the opportunity to
                            develop solutions across <b>branding</b>,
                            <b>communication</b>, and <b>logistics</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My <b>core</b> <b>responsibility</b> was the event‚Äôs
                            <b>visual</b> <b>identity</b>, designing banners,
                            posters, conference books, participant bags, and
                            collectible pins. I collaborated with colleagues to
                            coordinate printing and ensure materials were ready
                            on time.<br />I also created and maintained the
                            yearly and main <b>websites</b> on
                            <b>MediaWiki</b> making sure participants had
                            <b>clear</b> and <b>accessible</b> information. I
                            contributed to communications by drafting
                            announcements and <b>publishing</b> updates on the
                            <b>website</b>. As my role expanded, I engaged
                            directly with teams, especially Spanish-speaking
                            <b>participants</b> in <b>Latin</b> <b>America</b>,

                            Over eight competition cycles, I designed materials

                            with a <b>multidisciplinary team of experts</b> to
                            create instructional materials for
                            <b>safe practices in synthetic biology</b>, bridging
                            the gap between complex scientific topics and clear,

                            Beyond branding, I contributed to the

                            <b>coding</b> <b>projects</b>, adapting website

                            <b>hierarchy</b> for better <b>accessibility</b>. I
                            also redesigned and implemented fully

                            navigation and usability. Additionally, I introduced
                            multiple ways to navigate content, making it easier
                            for users with different learning styles to engage
                            with competition materials.<br /><br />I developed

                            feel distinct. My goal was to make every iGEM year

                            Beyond design, my role evolved into

                            As an <b>ambassador</b>, I supported teams in the
                            region by advising them on how to present their
                            projects effectively and addressing regional
                            challenges. Through
                            <b>public speaking engagements</b>, I honed my

                            My work at the <b>iGEM</b> <b>Foundation</b> was
                            <b>pivotal</b> in shaping my career, allowing me to
                            grow my skills; from web design and UI development
                            to science communication and branding. I was
                            fortunate to work with a close-knit team that
                            supported me through all the learning curves, laying
                            the foundation for my interest in the intersection
                            of <b>science</b>, <b>data</b>,
                            <b>communication</b> and <b>design</b>. This
                            <b>balance</b> of <b>creativity</b> and
                            <b>pragmatism</b> is something I look forward to
                            continuing in meaningful work. Collaborating with
                            students inspired me, and I feel both lucky and
                            grateful to have contributed to the largest event in
                            synthetic biology.
