                            My team and I explored how to keep users engaged on
                            their rest days by creating a

                            UX/UI design to make off-days feel valuable. The
                            goal was to keep users engaged and motivated even
                            when not working out. Through some small
                            <b>redesign changes</b> and
                            <b>precise copy edits</b> we gave users helpful tips

                        <p>
                            Freeletics, a fitness app with 59 million users, is
                            great at helping people reach their fitness goals.
                            Through personalized workouts, tailored to your
                            schedule and available equipment, the app is there
                            to make you the best version of yourself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But what happens on your days off? If you‚Äôve
                            scheduled three morning workouts a week, what keeps
                            you coming back on the other four days?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This was long-standing gap in the app:
                            <b
                                >how might we bring users back during their rest
                                days?</b
                            >

                            This was a tricky challenge as it needed to account
                            for multiple stakeholders, technical constraints,
                            and tight deadlines.

                        <p>
                            At the start, the problem was broad:
                            <b>why were users not engaging on rest days?</b>
                            There were several directions we could take‚Äîfrom
                            improving underperforming features to exploring new
                            engagement strategies. But with
                            <b>limited implementation time</b>, we needed to
                            define a clear goal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After conversations with the PM, my direct manager,
                            and other stakeholders, we aligned on a business
                            priority: <b>increase app opens on rest days</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This focus was especially important because our user
                            segmentation showed that
                            <b>73% of users rely on external motivation</b>.
                            Without regular touchpoints, they were more likely
                            to disengage completely.
                        </p>

                            With the goal aligned, I could narrow the scope and
                            make informed decisions. I studied the app and
                            asked:
                            <b

                            The home screen emerged as a key opportunity. It's
                            where users track their workouts, preview the week,
                            and decide what to do next. Since we couldn‚Äôt
                            redesign entire screens, I focused on
                            <b>small interventions</b> that reused existing
                            components and respected our tech constraints.

                            I turned my <b>research findings</b> into a set of

                            Together, we explored what could be implemented
                            quickly while still creating a meaningful experience

                        <p>
                            We discussed building a
                            <b>dedicated recovery hub</b> within the app‚Äîone
                            central place to host links to
                            <b>recovery routines</b> and curated
                            <b>blog articles</b>. I also outlined a
                            <b>content strategy</b> that would bring users back
                            with <b>push notifications</b>, introduce the
                            concept of <b>active recovery</b>, and offer ongoing

                        <p>
                            Since these ideas had broader implications, some
                            decisions‚Äîlike integrating a
                            <b>content management system</b> or curating content

                            plan to move forward with the current design phase
                            and revisit those constraints later.

                            I placed myself in the user‚Äôs position: what kind of

                            The article had to stand out, I designed a new type

                            interesting concepts or announcements for users. To

                            The next question we had to tackle was: how will

                            section. For this we planned simple

                        <p>
                            To support rest days, we decided to
                            <b>repurpose the ‚ÄúExplore More‚Äù screen</b>. This
                            section already featured workouts and single
                            exercises, so we brought <b>cooldown</b> and
                            <b>warm-up routines</b> forward as initial
                            suggestions.

                        <p>
                            We also proposed a <b>new feature</b> to surface
                            <b>blog articles</b> using their images as
                            backgrounds. While effective, this added
                            <b>content management complexity</b>, as articles
                            would need regular updates. We included it in the
                            <b>prototype as a proof of concept</b>, leaving full
                            implementation for a later iteration.

                            This required <b>minimal technical effort</b>, as it
                            reused an existing feature. The main challenge was
                            selecting which <b>recovery links</b> to display,
                            given our limited content. For the prototype, we
