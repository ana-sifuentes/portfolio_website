                        <p>
                            My team and I explored how to keep users engaged on
                            their rest days by creating a
                            <b>new content experience</b> for the Freeletics
                            app. I worked on the concept, copy, strategy, and
                            UX/UI design to make off-days feel valuable. The
                            goal was to keep users engaged and motivated even
                            when not working out. Through some small
                            <b>redesign changes</b> and
                            <b>precise copy edits</b> we gave users helpful tips
                            to fuel their recovery and increase app opens.

                        <p>
                            Freeletics, a fitness app with 59 million users, is
                            great at helping people reach their fitness goals.
                            Through personalized workouts, tailored to your
                            schedule and available equipment, the app is there
                            to make you the best version of yourself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But what happens on your days off? If you‚Äôve
                            scheduled three morning workouts a week, what keeps
                            you coming back on the other four days?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This was long-standing gap in the app: <br />
                            <b
                                >how might we bring users back during their rest

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was a tricky challenge as it needed to account
                            for multiple stakeholders, technical constraints,
                            and tight deadlines.

                            As a Freeletics user myself, I felt it too. On rest
                            days, I missed the same guidance and encouragement
                            that‚Äôs available during workouts.

                            This became the foundation for the Rest Days
                            concept. It aimed to shift the experience from
                            "nothing to see here" to "here‚Äôs something gentle,
                            helpful, and supportive." You don‚Äôt need to train
                            every day. But if you want to keep the habit going
                            or ease sore muscles, here‚Äôs how to do it with care.
                            The goal was to build consistency, not intensity.

                            This was especially important since according to our
                            user segmentation, 73% of our users thrive on
                            external motivation and is more likely to disengage
                            without regular touchpoints.

                            I knew from the start I couldn‚Äôt fix everything.
                            Freeletics already does a good job supporting
                            self-motivated users on training days. My job wasn‚Äôt
                            to redesign the core workout experience, it was to
                            improve the off-days. I had to set clear boundaries.
                        </p>
                        <p>So I framed the problem as:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4 highlight statement">
                        <h6>How might we...</h6>
                        <p>
                            increase app opens on rest days without contributing
                            to user burnout among our biggest active segment?
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <p>
                            With this in mind, I studied the app, where could I
                            have the biggest impact? <br />
                            The home screen is at the heart of the experience,
                            this is where users access their workouts and can
                            browse the calendar to see what other routines they
                            will have later in the week. Since we had to
                            consider a very limited implementation time, any
                            edits proposed had to be very precise and repurpose
                            some of the existing features.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I noted what I would focus on and what I would
                            avoid:

                            and Apple Health stood out for a different reason:
                            they track activity continuously, not just during
                            workouts. This makes it easier for users to feel
                            like ‚Äúsomething counts,‚Äù even if they‚Äôre just
                            walking the dog. I also browsed forums and noted
                            what users were commenting:

                            This stuck with me. People want consistency, but not
                            at the cost of burnout. They want permission to
                            rest, not pressure to perform every day.

                            Apps like Gentler Streak and Fitbit offer a
                            different approach. They treat recovery as part of
                            progress. They suggest lower-effort activities when
                            your body needs rest and offer recovery tools right
                            alongside more intense training options. They
                            reflect a more holistic view of fitness. Freeletics
                            should offer that kind of support too.

                    <h3>4. Proposal</h3>

                 <p>
                     I wanted these changes to be part of a broader strategy, not just a one-off edit. The goal was to develop a plan that would encourage users to build their own fitness routines and establish healthy habits. The content needed to evolve in a way that gently nudged users toward habit-building, increased app opens, and minimized technical effort through simple content swaps.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     To create lasting impact, I placed myself in the user‚Äôs position: what kind of experience would I expect from the app on a rest day? How would that differ from a training day? Since there were no existing triggers to incentivize opening the app on a rest day, the first step was to add a push notification‚Äîsomething to let users know there was something waiting for them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     If it was their first time encountering the concept of a rest day, or if they were new to the app, they should receive helpful information about what to do. This was especially important for people new to fitness who might believe that on rest days, they should avoid moving altogether. These insights could be delivered in the form of a mini article accessible at any time.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     From there, the home screen should offer an encouraging message about gentle movement. It should also link to rest-day routines and blogs with more details on active recovery, fitness, and nutrition tips.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     I then mapped these expectations into a user flow, identifying what would require new copy (including single and multiple variations), and what visual changes could reuse existing components versus those that would require new features.
                 </p>

                        <p>Once I had planned the user flow, I could focus on writing and designing.
                            I started with simple copy changes as they could have a big impact but they required minimal technical work, just some light logic updates.</p>

                           I wrote 10 variations of push notification variations
                           that would encourage the user to
                            open the app on their days off.
                            From the initial drafts I got the feedback that they should
                            be shorter so it wouldn't be cut off on the users display.
                            I trimmed my notifications and set them up for localization.

                            What kind of message should we have then? It had to be both encouraging and gentle.
                            Users also tended to explore previous and future days in their calendar,
                            so the message had to account for those cases as well.
                            As final touch, we decided to include emojis to add a friendlier feeling.

                            Users new to fitness might know the concept of active recovery, so we
                            decided to write a brief article to explain why they needed to come back
                            to the app on their days off and what they could expect on said days.
                            Originally we had planned to include an explanation to the internal
                            concept of "Base" but it muddied the messages and from user feedback
                            we knew this term was already confusing so we decided to remove it.
                        </p>
                        <p> The article was very brief and included lots of images, it also used one
                            of the highlight colors of the app to indicate this was something
                            special and new.</p>

                           Since the article had to stand out we wanted to place it a new type of layout
                           that would allow for easy reading with lots of images.
                           We could reuse this same layout when talking about new product features
                           or other interesting concepts or announcements for users.
                           To make sure it would be easy to build and use, we created a standarized
                           layout that content writers and designers could utilize.</p>

                           The next question we had to tackle was: how will users
                           access the articles again? Since we had planned
                           to write content for different concepts and
                           features in the app, we needed to show them in a way
                           that would standout from the other quick links section.
                           For this we planned simple content cards that would only
                           appear on rest days. </p>

                       We made one small change to the prototype to test the idea of a "Rest Day Essentials" screen where users could access a set of pre-selected blog articles and easier access to stretching routines. Users expected to see a large button that would allow them to start a recovery stretching session right after reading the material. Some users continued to explore from there, although others did not engage with the rest of the articles.</p>

                       <p>We took note of this and, depending on the results of further testing, we planned to implement these updates in the next iteration.</p>

                    <p>This project was an incredible learning experience. Within a tight timeframe, my team and I created a strategy for rest days, tested and refined a prototype, and delivered concrete copy and feature updates. Together, these changes added real value and helped users feel more supported in their fitness journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Working on Rest Days reinforced the idea that introducing a new feature needs to be holistic. The original challenge came from wanting users to open the app more often‚Äîbut we hadn‚Äôt given them a reason to do that on their recovery days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There were no gentle stretching sessions. No encouraging messages. Nothing to reassure users they were still making progress. That left people feeling like they were falling short.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Through user testing and a lot of empathy, we focused on meaningful changes over flashy ones. Simple, thoughtful copy can do a lot. It can guide, motivate, and make an experience feel premium‚Äîwhen it‚Äôs rooted in real user needs.
