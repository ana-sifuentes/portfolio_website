On the logistical side, I managed a <b>budget</b> of approximately <b>$15,000</b> to oversee travel arrangements and accommodations to give our delegates the best possible experience.</p><p>Each event required around <b>four</b> <b>months</b> of preparation, following a structured process that was iterated over time. With each cycle, <b>improvements</b> such as <b>additional</b> <b>training</b> sessions and <b>expert</b> <b>consultations</b> were incorporated to better support our participants.</p>

                        <p>The <b>Delegate Program</b> continues and has now been renamed to <a href="https://community.igem.org/" target="_blank">iGEM Community</a> as it continues to playing a key role in shaping the future of synthetic biology.  </p><p>Through this experience, I learned that <b>effective</b> <b>policy</b> <b>advocacy</b> is not just about understanding science, but about <b>bridging</b> <b>perspectives</b> and finding common ground. At the end of the day, policy is shaped by people—each with their own motivations and goals—working together to build a better future. This project was both a <b>challenge</b> and a <b>privilege</b>, and while it wasn't without its obstacles, I’m proud of the work we accomplished and the impact we made. I am grateful for the opportunity of accompanying these brilliant scientists during a pivotal moment in their careers. </p>
