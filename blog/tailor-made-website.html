                            This Doesn’t Fit Anymore <br />
                            What to do when your website feels "off."
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It’s the same feeling as <b>trying</b> on an
                            <b>old</b> <b>dress</b> in front of the mirror. Too
                            loose here, too tight there. A dress I once loved
                            and saw no flaws in <b>now</b> <b>feels</b>…
                            <b>off</b>. There are still <b>parts</b> of it
                            <b>I adore</b>: the color, the pattern, the way it
                            made me feel. But something has changed. That’s how
                            I feel about <b>my</b> <b>website</b> right now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve put <b>endless</b> <b>hours</b> into
                            <b>curating</b> it, lovingly writing about my
                            projects, but now <b>all</b> I <b>see</b> are its
                            <b>limitations</b>. It’s time to take it to the
                            <b>tailor</b> and give it <b>new</b> <b>life</b>.
                            Luckily, I have the skills to tailor it myself. And
                            since there’s no rush, I can take my time figuring
                            out exactly what I need.

                            question: <b>What</b> are the <b>current</b>
                            <b>limitations</b> of my <b>website</b>?

                        <h3>STEP 1: What do i want?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I’ve been thinking about <b>updating</b> my
                            <b>website</b> for a while. I’ve been with
                            <b>Squarespace</b> since 2019, after hearing about
                            it approximately 57 times in various podcasts and
                            YouTube videos. Before that, I managed to get by
                            without a <b>portfolio</b> at all. Working at my
                            first big job for 8 years made it unnecessary until
                            I wanted to apply for a <b>master’s</b>
                            <b>program</b>. Then I needed something to
                            <b>showcase</b> <b>my</b> <b>work</b>. It was promo
                            code time. <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, after 6 years with <b>Squarespace</b>, many of
                            their <b>selling</b> <b>points</b> still hold up
                            pretty well:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Easy to use</p></li>
                            <li><p>No coding required</p></li>
                            <li><p>Drag-and-drop interface</p></li>
                            <li><p>Blogging and publishing features</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            There are also plenty of <b>analytics</b> and
                            <b>commercialization</b> <b>features</b> I’m only
                            now discovering as I revisit their info website.
                            <br /><br />Ok, these all seems pretty good what are
                            the downsides then?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> is
                            <b>customization</b>. I can’t structure my website
                            exactly the way I want to. The dress currently can’t
                            be adjusted to my needs. What are those exactly?
                            <br />Glad you asked!

                            between these pages will be the level of detail.
                            Bigger projects will have a design that best suits
                            the content while smaller ones can do with an

                            So according to this, there should be
                            <b>7 </b>different <b>page</b> <b>types</b>:
                            <b>4 unique pages</b> and <b>3</b> types of
                            <b>templates</b>. I don’t need to reinvent the wheel
                            though, there are some <b>design</b> and
                            <b>layout</b> <b>elements</b> I like already from my
                            website. I can <b>keep</b> what I want. We are not
                            making the dress from scratch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, I already know what my <b>goals</b> are for
                            the site, so let’s define some <b>user</b>
                            <b>experience</b> ones. My new <b>website</b> should
                            be <b>easy</b> to <b>navigate</b>. I want visitors
                            to always <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they are, and
                            they should also <b>intuitively</b>
                            <b>know</b> there’s <b>more</b> <b>content</b> to
                            explore.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I write these blogs for myself, but hopefully
                            someone else might find them useful. <b>Key</b>
                            <b>pages</b> should be easy to find and they should
                            be <b>highlighted</b>. If I spent months working on
                            an <b>end-to-end design project</b>, we’re all going
                            to read it. <br />Right? Right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So now I know what I <b>want</b> and what I
                            <b>need</b> to <b>do</b>. Now I need to merge these
                            two into some <b>initial</b> <b>layouts</b>. Let’s
                            put some digital pen to digital paper and
                            <b>start</b> <b>sketching</b> in step 3.

                        <h3>STEP 3: how DO I organize my website?</h3>
                        <p>
                            <br />I’m bad at keeping surprises, you already saw
                            some of my <b>sketches</b>… <br /><br />I always try
                            to <b>sketch</b> for both <b>mobile</b> and
                            <b>desktop</b> since I'm expecting people to look at
                            my website on both devices. People who are
                            <b>reviewing</b> my <b>portfolio</b> might be more
                            likely to do so from their <b>laptop</b>, while
                            <b>blog</b> <b>readers</b> might do so on the go
                            from their <b>phone</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I said before, I don’t need to reinvent the wheel
                            when making this website. Even in my redesigns, I
                            can <b>reuse</b> <b>elements</b>. These will also
                            help users <b>navigate</b> the whole <b>site</b>, as
                            they’ll know what <b>patterns</b> to <b>expect</b>.
                            With this in mind, I sketched out how I want the
                            menu to look like on both devices. The <b>top</b>
                            <b>bar</b> with my <b>name</b> and the hamburger
                            <b>menu</b> can <b>remain</b> sticky at the
                            <b>top</b> of the <b>screen</b> so it's
                            <b>easy</b> to <b>access</b> <b>all</b> of my
                            <b>content</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also <b>subgrouped</b> the <b>pages</b> again
                            <b>by</b> types of <b>layout</b>: <br />
                            A) Main landing page<br />
                            B) Blog landing page + Project landing page<br />
                            C) Main project pages<br />
                            D) Secondary project pages + Blog articles<br />
                            E) Contact page

                        <p>
                            My plan to <b>reuse</b> <b>layouts</b> within these
                            subgroups will work very well. For example, when I
                            have several articles or projects, I want users to
                            <b>intuitively</b> <b>know</b> there are more to
                            <b>browse</b> if they <b>scroll</b> <b>down</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are <b>pages</b> that by their nature need to
                            be <b>unique</b>. Particularly the <b>main</b>
                            <b>landing</b> <b>page</b>, it will do a lot of
                            <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> to keep users on my
                            site. That page has the <b>responsibility</b> to
                            <b>set</b> the <b>tone</b> for everything that
                            follows, <b>introduce</b> <b>me</b>, and set some
                            <b>navigation</b> expectations. It has to be both
                            simple and engaging. That’s why I chose to have a
                            quick and fun executive summary of me and my work,
                            plus a <b>nice</b> <b>photograph</b> that says, “<em
                                >I am very obviously a designer.</em
                            >”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have some <b>initial</b> <b>layouts</b>!
                            Hurray!<br />What’s next?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I will let these <b>layouts</b> <b>sit</b> for a
                            bit. Like bread, they need some time to prove. I
                            want the ideas to linger in the back of my head for
                            a bit and see if <b>anything</b> <b>changes</b>.
                            Particularly for the <b>main project pages</b>,
                            these ones need to be able to best the serve the
                            contet so I simply made some <b>potential</b>
                            <b>layouts</b> I can use to <b>organize</b> the very
                            <b>thorough</b> <b>documentation</b> I will write.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I still need to <b>refine</b> and <b>clean</b> up my
                            <b>sketches</b> into actual clean
                            <b>wireframes</b> and then apply some styling. We
                            can say that we’ve <b>disassembled</b> the
                            <b>dress</b>, and that the <b>new</b>
                            <b>fashion</b> <b>sketches</b> are done. Next, I’ll
                            clean up my lines and look at <b>fashion</b>
                            <b>magazines</b> for inspiration. Then I need to
                            make the <b>pattern</b> before cutting the material
                            again. <br /><br />That <b>analogy</b> kinda makes
                            <b>sense</b>, right? <br />Let’s <b>say</b> yes for
                            now.<br /><br />
