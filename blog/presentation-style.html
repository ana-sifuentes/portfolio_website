                            Let’s continue deep diving into the art of
                            presentations. <br /><br />And the focus today?
                            <br />Finding your <b>personal</b> <b>style</b>!
                            <br />Let’s deliver the story you’ve so carefully
                            crafted in the <b>best</b> way <b>possible</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Giving a <b>presentation</b> is already a difficult
                            task, making it <b>memorable</b> in a
                            <b>conference</b> full of slide decks? That can feel
                            almost impossible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But be not afraid. I’ve collected my
                            <b>advice</b> into <b>3</b> <b>easy</b>
                            <b>steps</b>, and even enlisted the help of one of
                            the <b>best</b> <b>presenters</b> I know to bring in
                            some extra <b>magic</b>.

                        <h3>1) Knowing yourself</h3>
                        <p>
                            We’re going to start with a <b>mini</b> <b>quiz</b>:
                            choose <b>3</b> <b>words</b> to <b>describe</b>
                            <b>yourself</b>. Maybe ask a friend for help finding
                            your 3 <b>adjectives</b>. Here are some sets for
                            inspiration:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Reserved, calm, confident</p></li>
                            <li><p>Bubbly, fun, creative</p></li>
                            <li><p>Passionate, competent, smart</p></li>
                            <li><p>Charming, cool, interesting</p></li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Magnetic, curious, wise<br /></p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Once you nail down your <b>3 main</b>
                            <b>adjectives</b>, you can think about how they
                            <b>guide</b> the <b>way</b> you’ll
                            <b>deliver</b> your <b>slides</b>. These can change
                            over time as you gain more experience, but it’s good
                            to <b>find</b> your <b>essence</b>. During your
                            presentation, you can rely on different aspects of
                            your personality to emphasize certain parts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your style is <b>bubbly</b>, <b>fun</b>, and
                            <b>creative</b>, you can go through the presentation
                            <b>cracking</b> <b>jokes</b> where appropriate and
                            <b>having</b> <b>fun</b>. Say you have to share how
                            a <b>part</b> of the project went <b>wrong</b>, you
                            could do it like: “Did this work? Of course not.”
                            Most likely, the <b>audience</b> will
                            <b>laugh</b> along <b>with</b> <b>you</b>. But if
                            you are delivering <b>something</b>
                            <b>serious</b> and important, do it <b>solemnly</b>.
                            <b>Turning</b> <b>off</b> the “bubbly fun” and being
                            serious will <b>emphasize</b> it even <b>more</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What if your style is the opposite of this? Let’s
                            say <b>reserved</b>, <b>calm</b>, and
                            <b>confident</b>. Your <b>presentation</b> can
                            mostly progress at a <b>calm</b> <b>pace</b>, and if
                            you need to lighten the mood, try a <b>deadpan</b>
                            <b>joke</b> or a bit of <b>sarcasm</b> to show a
                            <b>shift</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Not</b> everyone will <b>deliver</b> the same
                            <b>information</b> in the <b>same</b> <b>way</b>.
                            The key here is finding what makes <b>you</b>
                            <b>comfortable</b> and the best way to share the
                            information. <b>Don’t</b> <b>force</b> your
                            <b>personality</b> onto the data - if something
                            didn’t work, there’s no need to jump for joy. Save
                            that energy for other slides.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You also need to <b>consider</b> your on the
                            <b>audience</b>, it can be hard having people like
                            you. Don’t worry if you <b>don’t</b> <b>get</b> it
                            <b>right</b> the first time - this comes with
                            <b>practice</b>. The more you’re on <b>stage</b>,
                            the more you’ll learn how to <b>react</b> to your
                            <b>audience</b>. With time, you’ll know when to
                            speed through a section to save time and when to
                            improvise an extra line to make a point crystal
                            clear. Keep trying. <b>Find</b> what makes you,
                            <b>you</b>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>2) Your personality, visually</h3>
                        <p>
                            Your <b>style</b> can also be reflected in your
                            <b>visuals</b>. This takes your presentation to the
                            next level and makes it truly memorable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you're on stage, people might not know you or
                            your story. Having <b>cohesion</b> between
                            <i>you</i> and what they’re seeing adds
                            <b>credibility</b> and <b>professionalism</b>. A
                            presentation can be the first time you “meet” - make
                            sure it leaves a great impression.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let’s use myself as an example, I’ll be:
                            <b>charming, cool, interesting.<br /></b> I try to
                            bring in <i>charm</i> with a few <b>small</b>
                            <b>details</b> - a couple of <b>emojis</b> when I
                            introduce myself <b>instead</b> of plain
                            <b>text</b>, a <b>little</b> <b>smile</b> on the
                            last slide, and always a thank you in my
                            <b>native</b> Spanish: <i>¡gracias!</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Cool</i> means something different for everyone,
                            but for me it’s a combination of being
                            <b>nice</b> and <b>knowledgeable</b>. I show this by
                            always <b>including</b> <b>attributions</b>. When I
                            share who inspired an idea, I’m
                            <b>acknowledging</b> the work of others and
                            <b>thanking</b> them for their <b>contribution</b>.
                            That’s always <b>cool</b>. I add small notes at the
                            bottom of slides or include pictures or screenshots
                            when applicable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As for <i>interesting</i>, I want the work I present
                            to speak for itself. Projects done with intention
                            and purpose. <b>Explaining</b> <b>why</b> you did
                            something and why it <b>matters</b> <b>brings</b>
                            <b>people</b> <b>in</b>. How do I do this visually?
                            I <b>reveal</b> information <b>slowly</b>, so we
                            <b>move</b> through the story <b>together</b>. I
                            highlight the parts that deserve attention - the
                            right image, a standout quote, or a number in bold
                            can do wonders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, <b>colors</b> and <b>details</b> will
                            change depending on what I’m presenting, but my
                            slides are always <b>recognizable</b> for their
                            <b>clean</b> <b>layout</b> and <b>strong</b>
                            <b>contrast</b>. This makes them <b>easy</b> to
                            <b>read</b> and <b>understand</b>. And what colors
                            feel charming, cool, and interesting to me?
                            <b>Grays</b> and <b>purples</b>.
                        </p>

                                    If your style is
                                    <b>reserved, calm, and confident</b>, use
                                    slides that reflect this: clean layouts,
                                    simple text, and a subtle pop of color when
                                    you want to highlight something.
                                </p>

                                    More <b>bubbly, fun, and creative</b>? Bring

                        <p>
                            Hey there! <br />I’m <b>Liza</b> and I’m a
                            <b>Quality Assurance Engineer</b>. Last November, I
                            had an amazing opportunity to speak at Agile Testing
                            Days conference with a 25-minute talk titled&nbsp;
                            “What’s left for a tester when team owns quality”. I
                            was super excited to find out that I made it to the
                            program but this excitement quickly turned into
                            realization - I needed to roll up my sleeves and
                            dive into preparation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main question I had to figure out was how do I
                            make this presentation interesting for other people
                            <b>and</b> myself? How do I turn the stressful prep
                            phase into something fun and creative? I knew I
                            wanted to draw a parallel between software
                            development and a tester’s role, but I couldn’t
                            quite land on the right metaphor. This is where my
                            hobbies came to rescue me. Around that time,
                            inspired by the Netflix series “Tour de France:
                            Unchained”, I was getting more serious about cycling
                            and I found myself riding more and more. And then it
                            clicked: I’ll combine my two passions - testing and
                            cycling - into one talk!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I ended up describing a tester’s role through
                            different roles on a Tour de France team. Every
                            slide was cycling-themed, and I blended in both my
                            own cycling journey and a few stories from the pro
                            cycling world. That helped me carry the metaphor
                            naturally throughout the entire talk, making the
                            presentation feel cohesive and personal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here are a few things I tried to stick to - maybe
                            they’ll be helpful for you too:
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <b
                                        >Find your story/theme for the
                                        presentation</b
                                    >
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Maybe it’s something that drives you personally -
                            like a new hobby or the aesthetics of your favorite
                            city, movie or children’s book. Some of the most
                            memorable talks I’ve seen were built around a strong
                            theme. For example, an RPG-style talk with character
                            builds and stats, or a career-change talk told like
                            a fairy tale with unicorns and elves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Not only will this help your presentation stand out,
                            but it will also make the entire preparation process
                            more enjoyable and engaging for you (and trust me -
                            the audience will notice when you’re genuinely
                            interested about your topic!)
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <b
                                        >Slides are there to support you, not
                                        the other way around</b
                                    >
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You are the star of the show. Don’t make your slides
                            more important than you, they are just visual
                            anchors. Imagine that your presentation setup broke
                            and you ended up without slides - you should be
                            still able to tell your story.&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Enjoy it</b></p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Think about what might bring you joy. Got a favorite
                            cat meme that makes you smile and relax? Consider
                            adding it to your slides! Or maybe you have a
                            colleague who’s interested in the topic and you know
                            it would be way more fun to prepare the talk
                            together - invite them to join you! As Anita said,
                            it’s all about knowing yourself and what makes the
                            process enjoyable for you.
