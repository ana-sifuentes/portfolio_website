                        <h3>Round 1: Calories</h3>
                        <p>
                            We start on a <b>controversial</b> topic:
                            <b>calories</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A quick disclaimer by your host:<br /><br />Often,
                            carbs get a bad reputation in <b>nutrition</b>. That
                            they‚Äôll make you gain weight or that your body
                            doesn‚Äôt actually need them. But <b>carbs</b> are
                            <b>essential</b> fuel for us. Carbs are broken down
                            into <b>sugars</b> that the <b>body</b> uses as
                            <b>energy</b>. The problem starts when we have
                            <b>extra</b> <b>energy</b> we don‚Äôt need, and this
                            gets stored in the body thus leading to
                            <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That being said, the judges can now rank our
                            contestants.<br />
                            ü•î <b>Potatoes</b> is the first one highlighted with
                            the lowest calories, followed by üåø
                            <b>Quinoa</b> and üçö <b>Rice</b>, with üçù
                            <b>Pasta</b> right behind them. On the next tier, ü•ñ
                            <b>Flatbread</b> stands alone, and finally, ü•£
                            <b>Oats</b> step forward with the highest calorie
                            count.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The audience claps, but the judges still seem
                            divided. Some support <b>lower</b>-
                            <b>calorie</b>
                            options as they need to be
                            <b>mindful</b> of their <b>weight</b>, while others
                            opt for <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> to fuel their
                            <b>intense</b> <b>cardio</b> sessions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We love a bit of controversy! The carbs smile
                            knowingly. <br />They‚Äôre used to dealing with both
                            criticism and demonstrations of undying love.

                            More drama! The judges have to
                            <b>adjust</b> the rules to properly
                            <b>evaluate</b> our <b>contestants</b>. It seems the
                            <b>differences</b> are <b>barely</b> there. After
                            some deliberation, the new rubric accounts for how
                            low the prices of carbs can be.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rubric is considering numbers from
                            <b>Germany</b>, specifically <b>Munich</b>. These
                            numbers were obtained from a <b>local</b>

                            The judges request the carbs to step forward one by
                            one. <br />Wait a second‚Ä¶the crowd gasps!<br /><br />Carbs
                            made up from more than one ingredient are on both
                            ends of the scale.<br />üçù <b>Pasta</b> is ranked as
                            the least expensive carb, ü•î <b>Potatoes</b> and üçö
                            <b>Rice</b> follow almost at the same time, and a
                            few seconds later it‚Äôs ü•£ <b>Oats</b>. üåø
                            <b>Quinoa</b> waits a bit more, perhaps because of
                            transportation and export costs, and then finally
                            it‚Äôs ü•ñ <b>Flatbread</b>.

                            We are at another very close event. The judges are
                            working tirelessly to adjust our scale once again.
                            While they review the rubric, let me give some
                            context to our audience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our carbs are <b>mostly</b> <b>vegan</b>! Only
                            <b>ü•ñ Flatbread</b> and <b>üçù Pasta</b>
                            <i>could</i> contain animal products like butter
                            or eggs. However, the overall amount of water needed
                            is not a lot, especially when you place it in
                            context with other foods like <b>ü•© Beef steak</b>,
                            which, for reference, needs over 1500 liters of
                            water per 100g.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rubric the judges are working on rates
                            sustainability based on the food‚Äôs
                            <b>water</b>
                            <b>footprint</b>, meaning the amount of water needed
                            to produce 100g. These are rounded estimates and
                            serve as a starting point. Keep in mind that a high
                            water footprint doesn‚Äôt account for
                            <b>transportation</b>
                            <b>costs</b> or other <b>emissions</b> related to
                            <b>production</b> and <b>distribution</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another thing we can consider here is
                            <b>social perception</b><i> </i>and<i> </em
                            ><b>global trends</b>. Let‚Äôs make a special mention
                            of <b>üåø Quinoa</b>, which became very popular a few
                            years ago as it was being marketed as a
                            <b>superfood</b>. (Side note: this is a
                            <b>marketing</b> <b>term</b>, not a scientific one.)
                            Although <b>üåø Quinoa</b> is a very healthy food
                            that also contains a bit of protein, the hype around
                            it increased so much that it affected prices
                            globally. You can read more about

                            Ah! <b>ü•î Potatoes</b> step forward with the lowest
                            water footprint, then it's <b>üåø Quinoa</b> and
                            <b>ü•£ Oats</b>. In the next tier, it‚Äôs
                            <b>üçù Pasta</b>, and finally <b>üçö Rice</b> followed

                        <p>
                            As our contestants get ready for the final event,
                            let‚Äôs share a bit about this new category.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>What is the glycemic index?</b><br />It‚Äôs a
                            number that tells you how <b>fast</b> your
                            <b>body</b> will
                            <b>transform</b>
                            <b>carbs</b> into <b>sugars</b>, specifically
                            glucose. This is especially important for people
                            with <b>diabetes</b>, but it‚Äôs also useful for
                            anyone looking to avoid that
                            <b>post-sugar-high crash</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Less</b>
                            <b>processed</b> foods tend to have a <b>lower</b>
                            <b>glycemic</b> <b>index</b> and, in turn, are often
                            more <b>nutritious</b> and <b>less</b>
                            <b>caloric</b> than highly processed ones. So, a low
                            glycemic index can be a helpful clue that you‚Äôre
                            eating something healthy.
                        </p>

                            glycemic index. In the medium range, we have

                            <b>ü•£ Oats</b>. Then in the low range, it‚Äôs
                            <b>üçù Pasta</b>, and finally <b>üåø Quinoa</b> with
