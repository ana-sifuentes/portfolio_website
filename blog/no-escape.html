                            playing <i>Hades</i> taught me about learning
                            German)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You are <b>not</b> meant to <b>succeed</b> the
                            <b>first</b> <b>time</b>. And you probably won't get
                            very far the next 10 tries.

                        <p>
                            In the game <i>Hades</i> the <b>premise</b> is
                            <b>failure</b>. You play as <b>Prince</b>
                            <b>Zagreus</b>, son of Hades, who tries to
                            <b>escape</b> the <b>Underworld</b> to find his
                            mother. However, the realm of the dead is designed
                            to keep those in it, inside it. You are not set up
                            for success—everything is trying to kill you, and it
                            will. Over and over again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It took me <b>more</b> than <b>30</b> tries just to
                            see the surface. I would <b>spend</b> an
                            <b>hour</b> <b>slashing</b> skeletons,
                            <b>evading</b> deadly spikes, and
                            <b>spilling</b> Titan blood everywhere—only to be
                            absolutely <b>skewered</b> by an ancient Greek hero
                            (<i
                                >Theseus, you are lucky the Gods are helping
                                you</i
                            >). But I kept coming back, I kept trying. It didn’t
                            matter—every time I played I knew I was going to
                            <b>fail</b>, and I was having <b>fun</b>.

                        <p>
                            But how does this connect to learning <b>German</b>?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond how difficult it can be, <b>learning</b> a
                            <b>new</b> <b>language</b> is about getting
                            <b>comfortable</b> with making <b>mistakes</b>.
                            There is no escape from that.

                            Before we dive into the current <b>hell</b> I’m
                            trying to <b>escape</b>, I have to let you know—I’ve
                            "escaped" other hells before. Aka, German isn't my
                            first rodeo.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Spanish</b> is my mother tongue, and I grew up
                            speaking <b>English</b> since my dad was an English
                            teacher. Over the years, I’ve studied <b>French</b>,
                            <b>Japanese</b>, <b>Chinese</b>, <b>Portuguese</b>,
                            and even a bit of <b>Swedish</b>—to various degrees
                            of success. I feel most comfortable switching
                            between English and Spanish, but I love to gossip in
                            Portuguese, and my French is enough to get by in
                            restaurants and shops. Whether it was
                            <b>formal classes</b>, the <b>app</b> with the green
                            owl, or simply <b>listening</b> to endless YouTube
                            <b>videos</b> (shoutout to Brazilian YouTube), I had
                            found strategies that worked for me to
                            <b>practice</b> and <b>learn</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And although German has humbled me and frequently
                            brought me down to my knees, I’m trying to translate
                            some lessons from <i>Hades</i> into my classes.

                        <p>
                            Every time you lose in <i>Hades</i>, you are
                            dispatched back to the starting point with this
                            gentle reminder. You can't expect to win the first
                            time—<b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b>. You have to
                            get <b>comfortable</b> with that <b>idea</b>. I will
                            <b>make</b> <b>mistakes</b> in German, I won’t be
                            perfect the first time, and for the life of me, I
                            won’t be able to pronounce <i>Monat</i> without it
                            sounding like <i>Monet</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I try to <b>stay</b> <b>positive</b>—I will always
                            fail, but I will always have the chance to
                            <b>try</b> <b>again</b>. Like in the game, each time
                            I will get a bit further… or not. But every try has
                            a new mini reward. Okay, I am back to square one,
                            but not quite. Sometimes, it’s as huge as getting a
                            new power-up, or simply noticing a new enemy. It’s
                            <b>leveling up </b>what counts.<br /><br />German
                            lessons feel like this. Sometimes, I come back to my
                            notes and realize only <b>one</b> <b>new</b>
                            <b>word</b> has stuck in my memory. Other times I am
                            defying the gods, when I finally understand
                            different between möchten and mogen. It’s the
                            <b>accumulated</b> <b>knowledge </b>what counts.

                        <h3>Lesson 2: Choose the right weapon</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the game, you can choose which weapon you will
                            use to <b>battle</b> off the endless
                            <b>wretches</b> waiting for a chance to sip on your
                            blood. Sword, spear, bow, shield, gloves, and even a
                            gun—which of these <b>legendary</b>
                            <b>weapon</b> should I use to defend myself against
                            German declensions? I had to try them all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this analogy, <b>weapons</b> are <b>learning</b>
                            <b>methods</b>: classes, apps, videos, exercises,
                            discussion groups, etc. My best runs have been with
                            a gun—and surprisingly, the times I’ve made the most
                            progress in German were when I combined
                            <b>one-on-one</b> <b>classes</b> with <b>quiet</b>
                            <b>study</b> <b>time</b>. Turns out in game I shoot
                            to kill from a distance and in real life I sit in
                            silence doing simple grammar exercises. It’s kinda
                            the same, no?

                        <h3>Lesson 3: Know your strengths and weaknesses</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first time I faced the <b>Bone</b> <b>Hydra</b>,
                            I died less than 2 minutes in—as expected. But after
                            playing for a few days, I had this monster
                            <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> vertebra by vertebra. Now,
                            I can clear this boss fight without much
                            <b>trouble</b>. But Theseus and his Minotaur buddy?
                            They kill most of my runs. I’ve come to
                            <b>accept</b> <b>this</b>. I know <b>where</b> I’m
                            likely to <b>fail</b> and where I’ll <b>succeed</b>.
                            So I build my <b>strategy</b> around that—I know
                            where I’ll need to invest extra resources to make it
                            through.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Spoken</b> German, for some strange reason, seems
                            okay to me—I can string together simple sentences
                            when I need to set up a doctor’s appointment.
                            <b>Reading</b> comprehension isn’t the worst
                            either—my English helps fill in some knowledge gaps.
                            But <b>writing</b> and <b>grammar</b>? It’s Theseus
                            and his Minotaur sending me back to the start.

                            Here is <b>where</b> I need to
                            <b>concentrate</b> and try to find some
                            <b>strategies</b> around those giant words that seem
                            like spears. It’s just a matter of
                            <b>memorizing</b> <b>patterns</b>.

                            the tutorial frequently. You <b>level</b>
                            <b>up</b> and <b>get</b> <b>better</b>—stop playing,

                            It’s about <b>skill</b>, it’s about <b>patience</b>,
                            it’s about <b>practice</b>. <br /><br />I have my
                            <b>A1</b> <b>exam</b> in a few weeks, and I’m
                            starting to feel the <b>pressure</b>. I won’t be
                            able to get a perfect no-damage run, but I can set a
                            <b>realistic</b> <b>milestone</b>—maybe make it out
                            of the first circle of hell <b>alive</b>.
                            <br /><br />I’m sure I’ll pass, but I want to be
                            confident enough to <b>enjoy</b> the <b>process</b>.
                            It’s time to put on the <i>Hades</i> soundtrack,
                            open <i>Grammatik</i> and get good.<br /><br />May
                            the gods help me.
