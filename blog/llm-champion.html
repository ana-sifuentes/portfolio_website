                        <p>
                            Last week we talked about <b>training an LLM</b> and
                            how to me it was similar to <b>Pokémon</b>. Well, we
                            are back from the <b>Safari Zone</b> again, me and
                            all my Pokémon and LLM knowledge are going for the
                            <b>championship</b>. What do I mean by this?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            1) I love <b>analogies</b> and <b>Pokémon</b><br />

                            2) We'll discuss <b>best practices</b> for
                            <b>LLM documentation</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are completely new to <b>LLMs</b> and just
                            need to understand how they work on a surface level,
                            I recommend
                            <a href="/blog/llm-champion"
                                >my blog post about LLMs</a
                            >
                            or even
                            <a href="/work/llm-training">my case study</a> on
                            how I implemented one. Today's focus is
                            <b>nitty-gritty details</b>. In Pokémon terms, we
                            aren't playing just for fun, we are here to win
                            <b>competitive tournaments</b>. That involves
                            looking at <b>stats</b> and calculating
                            <b>Effort Values (EVs)</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, let's pretend we are <b>training an LLM</b> to
                            talk about <b>Pokémon</b>. Ready to get very
                            technical today?

                        <h3>1) <b>Organizing Your Data</b></h3>
                        <p><i>At least 150 or more to see...</i></p>

                        <p>
                            First some technical details. <br />
                            The smallest piece of information <b>LLMs</b> handle
                            are called <b>tokens</b>. These can be characters,
                            words, or sentences. The way they are calculated
                            depends on the method the <b>LLM</b> is using to
                            process words and turn them into numbers that it can
                            more easily understand. You will see tools like
                            <b>ChatGPT</b> or <b>Lovable</b> having a limit of
                            how many tokens you can use unless you upgrade to a
                            paid plan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since <b>LLMs</b> can process only a limited amount
                            of information at a time, the best thing to do is to
                            break down your information into smaller pieces. If
                            you want to learn more about this process, I
                            recommend
                            <a
                                href="https://medium.com/the-research-nest/explained-tokens-and-embeddings-in-llms-69a16ba5db33"
                                >this article on Medium →</a
                            >.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The amount processed works for both ways, both from
                            the user's query and on the files the LLM is drawing
                            from to answer. For documentation purposes we just
                            need to focus on the training information being
                            <b>digestible</b> for our <b>LLM</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In our case my LLM could only pull data from around
                            <b>3</b> files, so I was very careful with my
                            <b>information architecture</b> I didn't want to
                            break down my data into a million pieces. To make
                            sure my structure worked, a
                            <b>data engineer</b> added a column that indicated
                            the <b>token count</b> of my file plus a visual
                            indicator if we were going over the limit. This way
                            I could quickly scan all the files as I scrolled
                            through the corpus. Ideally, I should stay around
                            <b>1000 tokens</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ok, now let's use an example to land these concepts
                            in <b>Pokémon</b> terms. What if I wanted a single
                            file that listed all the Pokémon names? Should we go
                            over the token limit? (<i
                                >By the way, the total discovered Pokémon as of
                                summer 2025 is <b>1,025</b>. </i
                            >)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I would prefer to break them down into
                            <b>alphabetical entries</b>, something like “Pokémon
                            Names A.” That way, if we are looking for my boy
                            <b>Haunter</b>, we can skip straight to H. Here’s
                            how I would structure it:
                        </p>

                        <br /><br />
                        <div
                            style="
                                background-color: #f1f1f1; /* dark gray */
                                display: flex;
                                justify-content: center;
                                align-items: center;
                                padding: 2rem;
                                flex-direction: column;
                                border-radius: 20px;
                            "
                        >
                            <p>
                                <b
                                    >[English name] [Pokémon type] [Generation]
                                    [Evolutions Y/N]
                                </b>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p>
                            What other relevant information could we add? Maybe
                            more details about <b>evolutions</b> or the
                            Pokémon’s <b>ID number</b>. But since we want to
                            keep our lists under the <b>token limit</b>, we need
                            to balance the amount of information. It’s ok if a
                            file ends up being smaller than others — we need to
                            account for categories where we might have more
                            data.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What happens if the file goes over the
                            <b>token limit</b>? It would <b>cut off</b>. The
                            <b>LLM</b> would only read up until the token limit,
                            so if crucial information was at the end of the
                            file, it wouldn’t show up. How would you know how to
                            get a <b>Haunter</b> in the game??? <br /><br />
                            Better break down your data.

                        <p><i>A new Pokémon type has been discovered!</i></p>

                        <p>
                            When <b>Steel</b> and <b>Dark</b> type Pokémon
                            dropped during the <b>second generation</b> release,
                            I was ecstatic. My beautiful <b>Sneasel</b> was
                            added to the list of Pokémon, and I had to have her
                            in my team!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But how do we add this new information to our
                            documentation? Here is where
                            <b>planning ahead will save you.</b> It’s easy to
                            organize everything if your information pool won’t
                            grow. Sadly, that’s almost never the case. We have
                            to be <b>flexible</b> and be prepared for when
                            <b>new data</b> comes our way.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let’s think of a concrete example: what if I wanted
                            to teach the <b>LLM</b> about <b>Eevee</b> and their
                            evolutions? My strategy would be to create a
                            <b>single file per Pokémon</b> that contained its
                            Pokédex entry:
                            <i
                                >name, evolution, brief description, type, move
                                list, etc.</i
                            >
                            This works much better than having a single file
                            with ALL the information of ALL the
                            <b>Eevee evolutions</b>. Even if a single entry
                            feels easier to update, it would be way too long,
                            and the <b>LLM</b> wouldn’t process it efficiently.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I could also create a <b>specific entry</b> that
                            explained the <b>Eevee evolutionary tree</b> in case
                            a user wanted to learn about this topic. That way,
                            the <b>LLM</b> would prefer drawing from this file
                            instead of opening every single file on
                            <b>Eevee</b>, <b>Flareon</b>, <b>Vaporeon</b>,
                            <b>Jolteon</b>... etc.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, if we wanted to add <b>Umbreon</b> as a new
                            <b>Eevee evolution</b>, our to-do list would look
                            like this:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Update the <b>“U” names list</b></li>
                            <li>
                                Update the <b>Eevee entry</b> to include the new
                                evolution
                            </li>
                            <li>Update the <b>Dark Pokémon list</b></li>
                            <li>Create a new <b>Umbreon entry</b></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <p><i> Pikachu, Pikachu, Pikachu</i></p>
                        <p>
                            Growing up watching <b>Pokémon</b> in Spanish and
                            playing the games in English, it never
                            <b>occurred</b> to me <b>Pokémon</b> had different
                            names in other regions. <b>Bulbasaur</b> was the
                            same guy on both sides of the border, but across the
                            ocean, in <b>Germany</b>, he is known as
                            <b>Bisasam</b>. I was <b>shocked</b> too; sometimes
                            when me and my favorite engineer talk about
                            <b>Pokémon</b> we need to Google who we are talking
                            about.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, this is not the case for <b>Pikachu</b>.
                            <b>Pikachu</b> is called <b>Pikachu</b> here in
                            Europe, on the American continent, and even in its
                            native Japan.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So what happens if we want to implement our
                            <b>LLM</b> in other regions?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This puzzle took me a while to figure out— as I
                            mentioned in my previous article (read it here), I
                            wanted to avoid translating all the information into
                            all the languages and then having to edit a cascade
                            of files when we had to make edits. Can you imagine?
                            The issues with version control, having to reach out
                            to translators to edit all the relevant files in
                            their language, the cost, the logistical nightmare
                            that would land a critical hit?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So how did I go about it? I tried a two-part
                            strategy; let’s use <b>Charmander</b> as an example.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the documentation I would specify all the
                            language variations, something like this:
                        </p>
                        <br /><br />

                        <div

                                padding: 2rem;

                                border-radius: 20px;

                            <p>
                                [<b>Pokédex</b> entry in <b>English</b>:
                                description, type, evolutions, move list, etc.]

                        </div>
                        <br /><br />
                        <p>
                            In the pre-prompt I added the specification that the
                            <b>LLM</b> should respond in the user's language and
                            it should use the translation specified, thus
                            avoiding that we would get a literal translation of
                            <b>Charmander</b>— idk, you could end up with a
                            Mexican <b>Charmander</b> being called Armando or
                            something.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With this strategy a German user who wanted to know
                            when <b>Glumanda</b> learns <b>Flammenwurf</b>, the
                            <b>LLM</b> would pull the information in English (<b
                                >Charmander</b
                            >
                            learns <b>Flamethrower</b> at level 24) and deliver
                            a correct answer in their language. Toll!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Quick disclaimer: this strategy wasn't bulletproof;
                            it worked in initial testing, but we had to make the
                            pre-prompt very robust and the documentation very
                            streamlined. Again, more testing is needed, but this
                            strategy might put you on the right path,
                            particularly if you are low on resources and end up
                            being the single <b>LLM</b> <b>Pokémon</b> trainer.
