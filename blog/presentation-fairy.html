                        <h3>Step 1: Defining</h3>
                        <p>
                            This one can be summarized as: <b>what</b> is your
                            <b>message</b> and <b>who</b> is it <b>for</b>?
                        </p>
                        <p>Let’s break it down.</p>
                        <ol data-rte-list="default">
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <b>What</b> are we trying to say?<br />You
                                    should be able to answer this in <b>one</b>
                                    <b>sentence</b>. Even if your topic is
                                    complex and you need to get lots of points
                                    across to all your key stakeholders, there
                                    is usually one <b>main</b> <b>idea</b> at
                                    the center of it. <br />Think: what should
                                    people <b>know</b> <b>after</b> your
                                    <b>presentation</b> that they didn’t know
                                    before? Is it explaining how your product is
                                    better than others? How your process saves
                                    time and improves results?
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <p>
                                    <b>Who</b> is the message for?<br />Knowing
                                    your <b>audience</b> is <b>crucial</b>.
                                    Depending on who they are is how you
                                    <b>tailor</b> your <b>message</b> and all
                                    <b>future</b> <b>decisions</b> in your
                                    presentation. You can’t cheat and say it’s
                                    for everyone – too generic and no one will
                                    get it. It’s good to have something in
                                    <b>common</b> with your audience, that way
                                    you know what information to leave out (as
                                    they already know it) and where to crack in
                                    a joke or two to <b>keep</b> them
                                    <b>engaged</b>.

                        <p>
                            By answering these two questions you should be able
                            to <b>form</b> a <b>statement</b> similar to this:
                            “I need to communicate this key product update to
                            the entire company.”

                        <p>
                            I’ll tell you two things. <br />First a
                            <b>secret</b> – <b>everyone</b> <b>loves</b>
                            <b>stories</b>. <br />Now something <b>cruel</b> –
                            <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has <b>time</b> for stories.<br />Can
                            we <b>reconcile</b> these two things? Yes – with a
                            <b>really</b> <b>good</b> <b>story</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A really good story is <b>simple</b>, <b>easy</b> to
                            <b>understand</b>, and leaves people <b>wanting</b>
                            <b>more</b>. You can use the
                            <a

                            >
                            for <b>inspiration</b>. A lot of stories already
                            follow this <b>pattern</b>, and if people are used
                            to this narrative, that’s <b>one</b> <b>less</b>
                            <b>thing</b> they have to process from your
                            slides.<br /><br />Here is my general
                            <b>outline</b> translated for a <b>presentation</b>:

                            <b>break</b> <b>down</b> your <b>information</b>;
                            <b>less</b> <b>text</b> on one slide means
                            <b>more</b> <b>emphasis</b> on what’s on screen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Don’t</b> <b>focus</b> on <b>styling</b> during
                            this step. A <b>simple</b> <b>white</b> background
                            with <b>black</b> text should be enough. Why no
                            styling yet? We’ll tackle that in the next step. And
                            especially if you’re short on time, <b>focus</b>
                            <b>on</b> having <b><i>something</i></b
                            >. I prefer to have a simple slide deck than no
                            slide deck at all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is also a <b>good</b> <b>point</b> to bring in
                            external <b>consultation</b>. <b>Ask</b> a colleague
                            or a friend:<br />Is my message clear? Am I missing
                            some information? <br /><br />Better to fix it now
                            than after spending hours tinkering with slide
                            transitions.

                        <p>
                            Congrats! If you made it this far, it means you
                            <b>already</b> <b>have</b> a <b>slide</b>
                            <b>deck</b>. <br />Now let’s make it better.<br />Here
                            are some questions to consider in this step:
                        </p>
                        <ul data-rte-list="default">
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Do you have a <b>brand</b> or
                                    <b>palette</b> you need to follow?
                                    <br />Maybe an existing <b>template</b> from
                                    your company?
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Any key <b>charts</b> or <b>graphs</b> that
                                    we can include?
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Photos</b> that can replace an entire
                                    paragraph?
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Big <b>numbers</b> we should highlight?</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    An <b>important</b> <b>quote</b> that
                                    inspired the project?
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Another magic trick I’ve picked up is to
                            <b>visualize</b> <b>everything</b>. This can be as
                            simple as adding an image, emphasizing one key word,
                            or showing a big number.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, a warning: this step can be a time sink – we
                            both know <b>perfection</b> <b>doesn’t</b>
                            <b>exist</b>, not even with magic. Be
                            <b>mindful</b> of how much <b>time</b> you actually
                            have to mess with the slides. Ask yourself: does
                            this have to be the perfect shade of blue or does it
                            just need <b>enough</b> <b>contrast</b> for people
                            to see?<br />You have to know when to stop –
                            basically just make sure that <b>colors</b> and
                            <b>fonts</b> are <b>easy</b> to <b>see</b>. You can
                            quickly check by <b>testing</b> your
                            <b>slides</b> on a <b>projector</b>: will the people
                            sitting at the back be able to see it? Then it’s
                            <b>good</b> <b>enough</b>.
                        </p>

                            The <b>final</b> <b>part</b> is to <b>rehearse</b>.
                            Go through your slides a <b>few</b> <b>times</b>, do
                            quick mock presentations <b>with</b> a
                            <b>friend</b> – it also works even if you do it in
                            <b>silence</b> by <b>yourself</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You should be able to <b>explain</b> the
                            <b>story</b> <b>without</b> the <b>slides</b>.
                            Because here is the final secret: the
                            <b>slides</b> aren’t there for you to remember, much
                            less for you to read. They’re <b>for</b>
                            <b>your</b> <b>audience</b>. They will use them as
                            <b>visual</b> <b>support</b> – that way they can
                            easily remember a key number you mentioned and
                            <b>understand</b> your <b>message</b> <b>beyond</b>
                            <b>words</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you feel <b>comfortable</b> with everything,
                            it’s time to <b>enjoy</b>. You’ve already done all
                            the work. Have <b>fun</b> presenting, maybe test out
                            a <b>joke</b> or <b>two</b> – find the best way for
                            you to cast this spell.
