                        <p>
                            What toys did you ask for as a kid? Me? I liked
                            <b>artist sets and ponies</b>. Those Lisa Frank sets
                            with unicorns? <b>My dream</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I think I studied art because of that. An entire
                            childhood drawing and sketching on my notebooks.
                            <b>Sorry mom</b>.

                        <p>
                            I also have to admit I try to be very
                            <b>organized and clean</b>. I get overwhelmed by
                            chaos. Maybe this is a reaction coming from
                            Monterrey.<i>

                            <br />
                            These two sides, <b>art and order</b>, are the
                            fundamentals of design to me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’ve been designing professionally for
                            <b>more than 12 years</b> at this point. Design
                            feels natural to me. Is there a single process I
                            always use when starting a project? If I’m very
                            honest, <b>no</b>—it’s a bit different when I paint
                            a <b>mural </b> versus when I come up with a
                            <b>communication strategy </b>.
                            <br />
                            But today I wanted to do a quick outline of
                            <b>how I usually work</b>, as it has really worked
                            out for me.

                        <h3>1. Understand – Define – Research</h3>

                        <i><h4>What, Who, Why?</h4></i>
                        <p>
                            Before I start sketching or coming up with ideas, I
                            try to take a step back and
                            <b>look at the big picture</b>. What am I doing and
                            who is it for?
                            <br />
                            This is something I learned with time. I used to get
                            very excited in my early days and run to grab paper
                            and pencil. Now, with more experience, I realize
                            that it doesn’t matter if your first idea is great,
                            what matters is that you are
                            <b
                                >providing the right solution for the right
                                audience</b
                            >.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            UX research tools come in very handy here:<b
                                >user personas, emotional maps, user
                                interviews</b
                            >. Any input I have from the final user helps me
                            start shaping all my decisions with them in mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The last part here is: if you can also
                            <b>explain why</b> you are doing this project, you
                            are golden. You want to be able to say to your team
                            or clients what the <b>business outcomes</b> will
                            be. Is it increasing app opens? Promoting the
                            client’s new site? Reaching a new target audience?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b
                                >All my design decisions will keep this in
                                mind.</b
                            >
                        </p>

                        <div class="spacer-mid"></div>
                        <i><h4>Scope</h4></i>
                        <p>
                            The next thing I need is to
                            <b>define what constraints</b> I have to keep in
                            mind. Even in a perfect world I know I won’t have
                            endless time and money to work on a project. Most
                            likely it will be:
                            <b
                                >what is the most you can deliver in the least
                                amount of time?</b
                            >
                            But also, it should be <b>high quality</b> and
                            <b>not too expensive</b>. What a wonderful equation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defining a <b>clear scope</b> will prevent you from
                            going down any rabbit holes chasing ideas that are
                            not feasible with the constraints you have. This is
                            crucial if you are working with a team that will
                            implement your ideas, <b>talk to them</b> to make
                            sure you’re not creating a design that will take 3
                            years to code properly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Make your list of
                            <b>essentials and nice-to-haves</b>. Discuss and
                            compromise. Remember that your decisions are not in
                            favor of you or your client, they need to be made
                            for the <b>final user</b>.
                        </p>

                        <i><h4>External + Internal</h4></i>
                        <p>
                            Regardless of how unique I think my design is, I
                            know I'm not reinventing the wheel.
                            <b>What have other designers done in the past?</b>
                            How have similar projects solved this problem?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also like discussing with my team or clients what
                            solutions we’ve tried in the past or what other
                            projects can be a good source of inspiration.
                            <br />
                            It’s important to do research. You can even learn
                            from solutions you don’t like.

                        <p>
                            Now that I have clearly defined what I need to do,
                            it's finally <b>time to sketch</b>. I let my
                            imagination run wild for a bit, encourage
                            outside-the-box thinking, pretending there is only a
                            <b>blue sky forecast</b> for the future.

                            <br />
                            I have to be very critical. Would this work under
                            our current constraints or should we mark it down
                            for v2? Once my best ideas survive, I take them to
                            the team for feedback. After a bit of back and forth
                            and discussion, we all make sure that the solution
                            we are proposing is <b>bulletproof</b> before
                            starting to work.

                        <p>
                            With the rough sketches as a guide, I can start
                            refining things, grabbing pens and colors, so to
                            say. Here is where the design starts
                            <b>taking shape</b>. I try to think about it as
                            assembling a puzzle. I want the parts to be
                            <b>modular</b>. If down the line we need to make
                            changes, it shouldn’t destroy the whole thing.
                            <br />
                            This also helps with implementation. If you
                            <b>break things into bite-sized mini projects</b>,
                            it’s easier for everyone on the team to know what
                            steps to prioritize and what to grab next.

                            worth even more?
                            <b>In product design, yes.</b> Having a good model
                            of how things should work is going to make
                            explaining it very easy. People stop being passive
                            observers and can actually
                            <b>interact with your design</b>, making it easier
                            to understand your ideas.

                            A good prototype doesn’t have to be perfect. It
                            doesn’t need to mimic all the app’s gestures, just
                            the new ones you’ve designed. And if you have extra
                            time, perhaps you can <b>try to anticipate</b>
                            what other buttons the user would want to click.
                            <br />
                            But don’t worry, you will soon find out what buttons
                            were essential all along during the next step:
                            <b>testing</b>.

                        <h4><i>Talking to users</i></h4>
                        <p>
                            When I have something ready, it's time to show it to
                            <b>external people</b> outside the project.
                            Depending on the budget and resources, we can do
                            external testing through different online tools,
                            unmoderated testing, surveys, interviews—you name
                            it. Watching people
                            <b>interact with what I created</b>
                            is very enriching. This lets me see if the plane
                            would fly in the real world and what final
                            <b>adjustments</b> we can make if needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now if we have neither time nor money, it's time to
                            get creative. <b>Anyone external</b> to the project
                            can help. Friends and family who haven’t seen the
                            process or don’t know about the project. If someone
                            who has no idea about the topic you’re designing for
                            can still get something out of it,
                            <b>you’ve done something well</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This isn’t the most recommended methodology, but
                            even showing your work to someone with a
                            <b>different cultural background</b> can help you
                            point out blind spots.

                        <h4><i>Edits</i></h4>
                        <p>
                            I’ve been making small edits all along the project,
                            but if during testing we need to do some
                            <b>major revisions</b>, here is where my planning
                            comes in handy. Do we need to switch an entire
                            section because users find it confusing? No problem,
                            we only need to work on that part and it
                            <b>shouldn’t affect the others</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Has it happened that sometimes I’ve had to do
                            redesigns in later stages? Earlier in my career,
                            yes.
                            <b>Nowadays</b>, following the process avoids
                            this—making sure we have a <b>clear brief</b> we all
                            agree on and asking for constant feedback from the
                            team prevents this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In any case, <b>mistakes can happen</b> and the best
                            thing to do is to find compromise. Yes, we can make
                            all those edits, but do you prefer to meet the
                            deadline or for it to be perfect? Sometimes it’s
                            better to make the bigger changes
                            <b>after we meet the initial release date</b>. We’ll
                            figure out a way to spin it to our advantage when we
                            tell users. <b>Cool new update coming soon</b>. Life
                            is what you make of it.
                        </p>

                        <h4><i>Final files</i></h4>
                        <p>
                            Once everything is done, I make sure I prepare all
                            the <b>final details</b>. Name all the files
                            correctly, add the documentation that is needed. I
                            like to prepare a <b>reference sheet</b> in case I
                            catch a cold on the final day. At this point, I’ve
                            done my part and the team can ask questions to my
                            documentation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I try to organize my things as I go, but if time is
                            getting the best of me, it can still be done in this
                            final step. The important thing is that we
                            <b>meet the deadline</b>
                            and the files are as perfect as can be.

                            And that’s it, that’s how it usually goes for me. Of
                            course, if I’m working on a different project, some
                            steps might <b>overlap or repeat</b>. If we need to

                            results, we might need to do more rounds of

                            What works best for me is having a
                            <b>framework</b> I can refer to before starting to
                            sketch. I never stopped loving <b>design</b> and
                            <b>organization</b>, and if I’m fully
                            honest—<b>ponies</b>. I take my work seriously, but
                            also with a lot of <b>joy</b>. It’s fun for me to
                            find <b>solutions</b>.
