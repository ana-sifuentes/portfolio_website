                            It happens to a lot of people. You’re at the
                            <b>doctor’s</b> <b>office</b>, and it’s time for
                            your <b>vaccine</b>. Oh, here comes the <b>pain</b>.
                            My arms get tingly, I can barely feel my hands, and
                            my stomach tightens. I <b>focus</b> on my
                            <b>breathing</b> and close my eyes. Suddenly, a
                            <b>tiny</b> <b>prick</b>—and it’s <b>over</b>. This
                            feels like a silly example but sometimes, the of
                            <b>fear</b> the <b>potential</b> <b>pain </b>is
                            bigger than the actual pain itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like many people, I’ve dealt with <b>anxiety</b> for
                            a good portion of <b>my</b> <b>life</b>. While I’ve
                            had periods where I could momentarily forget about
                            it. I’ve also gone through difficult eras where it
                            <b>caused</b> me <b>physical</b> <b>pain</b>. After
                            a lot of <b>therapy</b> and huge amounts of
                            <b>self-work</b>, I finally <b>understand</b> what
                            <b>triggers</b> my anxiety and how to <b>keep</b> it
                            <b>under</b> <b>control</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recently, I watched <b><i>Inside Out 2</i></b
                            >, and it reminded me just how much my
                            <b>relationship</b> with <b>anxiety</b> has
                            <b>changed</b>. The <i>Inside Out</i> movies are a
                            great way to explain emotions, showing how Riley’s
                            <b>primary</b> <b>emotions</b> (Joy, Anger, Fear,
                            Sadness, and Disgust) help her navigate life. In the
                            sequel, we meet more <b>complex</b>
                            <b>emotions</b> that emerge during puberty: Ennui,
                            Envy, Embarrassment, and Anxiety. This last one
                            pushes Riley to the edge, using her
                            <b>imagination</b> <b>against</b> <b>her</b>, making
                            her <b>second</b>-<b>guess</b> <b>herself</b>, and
                            planting a <b>dark</b> new <b>thought</b>:
                            <b>I am not enough.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Yikes</b>.</p>
                        <p>
                            This felt familiar. But surprisingly, it didn’t hit
                            me as hard anymore. I felt calm, with a tinge of
                            <b>sadness</b>, watching Riley <b>struggle</b>. I
                            had been there, but now, my <b>anxiety</b> sits like
                            an <b>exotic</b> <b>pet</b> at my feet. Sometimes a
                            bit <b>wild</b>, but mostly <b>domesticated</b>. I
                            almost wanted to reach through the screen and tell
                            her:

                        <h3>Recognizing the demon</h3>
                        <p>
                            It took me a while to figure out I had
                            <b>anxiety</b>. I had normalized it so much that it
                            was just <b>part</b> <b>of</b> my <b>life</b>. If
                            someone told me, <i>"We need to talk,"</i> I would
                            have a <b>stomach</b> <b>ache</b> leading up to the
                            conversation. If I had a bit too much fun on a night
                            out, the <b>endless</b> <b>overthinking</b>:
                            <i>"I did something wrong"</i>, was just the price
                            of that extra glass of wine. Made the wrong joke? Of
                            course, I had erased all the good memories and now
                            my friendship was in peril and
                            <b>everyone hated me</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These thoughts happen to everyone. Right? To some
                            extent, I would say yes. But they <i>shouldn’t</i>.
                            Everyone makes mistakes, but you <b>shouldn’t</b>
                            <b>torture</b> yourself for countless hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It wasn’t until I started <b>therapy</b> for a
                            completely unrelated reason (my story with toxic
                            relationships is for another time) that I got
                            diagnosed with <b>mild</b> <b>depression</b> and
                            <b>mild</b> <b>anxiety</b>. <i>Fun.</i> I remember
                            joking,
                            <i
                                >"Well, at least they aren’t spicy. Those would
                                be harder to handle."</i
                            >
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even before the diagnosis, I used to imagine all
                            these <b>negative</b> <b>thoughts</b> as a little
                            <b>demon</b> <b>thing</b>. A black, vaguely
                            cat-shaped figure that would get in between my feet
                            and yell at me at night. I would <b>draw</b> this
                            <b>little</b> <b>demon</b> every now and then, and
                            at one point I wrote a short story in college of how
                            I would have to <b>feed</b> <b>it</b>
                            <b>chicken</b> <b>bones</b> even though I was
                            <b>vegetarian</b> back then. I think this
                            visualization was heavily inspired by this short
                            film,

                            <b>pushing</b> it <b>away</b> to <b>no</b>

                        <p>
                            After my <b>diagnosis</b>, I wondered what to do
                            next. <br />I stayed on track with
                            <b>therapy</b> and asked for homework. <b>I</b>
                            <b>wrote</b>. I sat in my own <b>discomfort</b>,
                            trying to <b>unravel</b> it. I sought out stories
                            that explored <b>trauma</b> and
                            <b>anxiety</b> (shoutout to <i>Legend of Korra</i>).
                            I made <b>playlists</b>. I <b>wrote</b> <b>more</b>.
                            More <b>therapy</b>, more <b>conversations</b> with
                            friends. A lot of <b>reading</b> and, most
                            importantly, <b>brutal</b> <b>honesty</b> with
                            <b>myself</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This <b>process</b> has taken <b>years</b>. I’ll
                            share more about why it was so complex in future
                            blogs, but in short, my <b>anxiety</b> was tangled
                            up with other <b>personal</b> <b>traumas</b>. That’s
                            why it was so <b>hard</b> to <b>pinpoint</b> and
                            <b>isolate</b>. A normal situation, like a friend
                            taking a bit too long to reply, would make me
                            <b>spiral</b> into: “<i
                                >I did something wrong. They hate me. I screwed
                                up completely”.</i
                            >
                            Over time, those thoughts have quieted. I’ve
                            <b>learned</b> to <b>take</b> a <b>moment</b>, think
                            things through <b>rationally</b>, and <b>calm</b>
                            <b>down</b> my silly little <b>anxiety</b>
                            <b>pet</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Time has also helped. <b>I know</b>
                            <b>myself</b> better now. I know what sets the
                            <b>demon</b> <b>off</b>. It's like training a
                            strange, exotic pet. <b>Heavy</b> <b>foods</b> give
                            me a stomach ache similar to an anxiety flare, so I
                            try to avoid them. <b>Too much drinking</b>, and
                            I’ll toss and turn all night, my brain chewing on
                            the same mistake. <b>Investing</b> <b>energy</b> in
                            people <b>who</b> <b>don’t</b> <b>invest</b>
                            <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in me? That one used to send
                            me into a <b>very negative place</b>, questioning my
                            <b>own</b> <b>worth</b>. I’ve learned to focus my
                            love and care on people who are willing to give it
                            back.

                            Recently, my new therapist (hi, Dani!) mentioned
                            something that stuck with me: <i>Some of these </i
                            ><b><i>triggers</i></b
                            ><i> </i><b><i>wouldn’t</i></b
                            ><i> </i><b><i>bother</i></b
                            ><i> you if you were </i><b><i>doing</i></b
                            ><i> </i><b><i>well</i></b
                            ><i>.</i> And after long <b>years</b> of
                            <b>self-reflection</b>, I think I’m almost there. A
                            demon, fully domesticated.

                        <h3>Domesticating the demon</h3>
                        <p>
                            My <b>exotic</b> <b>pet</b> is <b>capable</b> of a
                            lot of <b>damage</b>. <b>Hyper</b>-<b>fixating</b>
                            on the smallest <b>details</b>, turning over every
                            single word I’ve said, seeing a
                            <b>situation</b> from <b>every</b> possible
                            <b>angle</b> like the mysterious Borgian Aleph,
                            <b>imagining</b> <b>endless</b>
                            <b>scenarios</b> like alternative realities, and
                            trying to come up with <b>strategies</b> <b>for</b>
                            <b>each</b> of them. It has <b>endless</b>
                            <b>energy</b>. It’s a tornado, a monster, a demon.
                            If I don’t stop it, it won’t stop.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By now, I know I can keep it <b>under</b>
                            <b>control</b> if I <b>avoid</b> certain
                            <b>behaviors</b> and stick to a <b>healthy</b>
                            <b>lifestyle</b>. Long walks and good conversations
                            are like walking it on a leash, but every now and
                            then, it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>run free</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And that’s when I realized something. All the
                            <b>vices</b> I mentioned above,
                            <b>overanalyzing</b>, <b>overplanning</b>, and
                            <b>obsessing</b> over details, could actually be
                            <b>virtues</b> in the <b>right</b> <b>context</b>.
                            Organizing an event and need to think through every
                            detail? Planning a new feature and trying to
                            anticipate potential user pain points? Refining a
                            content strategy to make sure it holds up under
                            every possible scenario? Those are <b>jobs</b> for a
                            <b>demon</b>. <br />That’s when I learned I could
                            let the demon <b>run</b> <b>free</b>: <b>at</b>
                            <b>work</b>. Still within a controlled space so it
                            wouldn’t go crazy, but I could <b>unleash</b>
                            <b>my</b> <b>anxiety</b> on <b>specific</b>
                            <b>projects</b> where <b>overthinking</b> was an
                            <b>asset</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A recent <b>example</b> was when I was creating a
                            <b>content</b> <b>strategy</b> for training an LLM
                            (<a href="/llm-training.html">read more here</a>)
                            and I needed to <b>document</b> the
                            <b>process</b> for my <b>intern</b>. Since we worked
                            in different time zones, my <b>instructions</b> had
                            to be <b>crystal</b> <b>clear</b> and cover as many
                            scenarios as possible so I wouldn’t slow down his
                            work while I slept. <br /><br />I gave <b>my</b>
                            <b>demon</b> <b>a task</b>:
                            <i
                                >Be as thorough as you can be. Think of
                                everything. Test it. Make sure anyone would
                                understand it.<br /><br /></i
                            >Now go. <b>Run</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b>
                            <b>free</b>.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                            It would be <b>misleading</b> if I sold this as
                            something that <b>happened</b> <b>overnight</b>.
                            Like one day I simply <b>changed</b> my
                            <b>perspective</b> and immediately <b>took</b>
                            <b>control</b>. It would also be a lie if I told you
                            this demon never has its <b>wild</b>
                            <b>days anymore</b>. Despite my best efforts, I
                            sometimes get <b>bad</b> <b>stomach</b> aches when I
                            hear "<b>we need to talk</b>”. I still try to avoid
                            french food as much as I can, it’s too heavy for me.
                            Although croissants are fine, always.

                            These days, for the most part, the <b>demon</b> just
                            bites my ankles every now and then and makes me
                            <b>apologize</b> for things I shouldn’t. It’s more
                            <b>silly</b> <b>than</b>
                            <b>dangerous</b>.<br />Thinking of my
                            <b>anxiety</b> as something <b>external</b> to me
                            has helped me understand it. <br /><b
                                ><i>I am not the demon</i></b
                            ><i>; I just have to deal with one.</i> It might be
                            with me <b>forever</b>, but if I can
                            <b>recognize</b> it, <b>accept</b> it,
                            <b>understand</b> it, and even become fond of some
                            aspects of it, I can <b>harness</b> it.

                            In the past, I was more <b>afraid</b> of what
                            <b>could</b> <b>happen</b>, but when something
                            actually did happen, it was <b>never</b> <b>as</b>
                            <b>bad</b> as I had imagined. I’ve survived every
                            crazy situation I found myself in. Most of the
                            things I <b>worried</b> about <b>never</b> turned
                            out to be <b>as bad</b> as I thought. The
                            <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>pain</b> was
                            <b>worse</b> than the actual pain.

                            These days, the <b>demon</b> <b>works</b>
                            <b>too</b>, it has to <b>pay</b> <b>rent</b> for
                            living in my head. <br />With time, we have become
