                        <p><b><i>Science can be hard.</i></b><br><i>Here are some tips to make communicating it easy.</i><br><br>Let me tell you about one of my previous lives. <br>I used to help student teams with <b>science</b> <b>communication</b>.</p><p>Was I a <b>scientist</b> in this past life? No. I’ve <b>always</b> been a <b>designer</b>- I can’t escape this fate. But I had been in their place before. Before working as the <b>Visual</b> <b>Designer</b> at <b>iGEM</b> <b>Headquarters</b> (<a href="https://anasifuentes.com/synbio-branding">read more here</a>), I participated as a <b>student</b> in 2011 and 2012. My role was communications and visuals;  <b>website</b>, scientific <b>poster</b>, and made the <b>presentation</b>.</p><p>iGEM teams work a lot. They spend <b>months</b> on <b>research</b> and planning, days and <b>days</b> in the <b>lab</b>, and countless hours <b>documenting</b> their <b>tests</b> and <b>results</b>. Then in the fall, they have to present their project to an <b>international</b> <b>audience</b> in English. Some teams have the advantage of communicating in their native language, but the vast majority have the extra difficulty of <b>translating</b> their <b>work</b>. Clear <b>communication</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> to make sure their audience understands their project.</p><p>Working at iGEM for almost 8 years, I watched a <b>lot</b> of <b>presentations</b>, <b>posters</b>, and <b>websites</b>—<b>more</b> than <b>300</b> <b>international</b> <b>teams</b> join the competition every year. After seeing so many, I started spotting some patterns and tips.<br><br>What made a <b>project</b> <b>easy</b> to <b>understand</b> for other <b>scientists</b> and the <b>general</b> <b>public</b>?</p><p>In my designer eyes, it was <b>3 things</b>. </p>

                        <h3>Step 1: Simple Sentence</h3><p>The <b>first</b> <b>question</b> I asked the team was: what is your <b>project</b> <b>about</b>?</p><p>The best <b>answers</b> were <b>simple</b>:<br> We are removing pests from plants.<br> We are developing an allergy detection kit.<br> We are modifying bacteria to collect plastics.</p><p>Being able to explain your project <b>helps</b> in <b>more</b> ways than you think. It will make you memorable not only to your peers, but it’s also very <b>useful</b> when you are <b>fundraising</b> and need to <b>convince</b> local <b>investors</b> to help you pay for the competition expenses.</p><p>Want a <b>good</b> <b>exercise</b> to get to a <b>simple</b> <b>sentence</b>? <br>Here is my recommendation: try <b>explaining</b> your project to <b>different</b> <b>people</b>.</p><ul><li><p><i>A scientist friend outside of the project</i></p></li><li><p><i>A friend studying something different</i></p></li><li><p><i>Your parents</i></p></li><li><p><i>Younger siblings</i></p></li><li><p><i>Your grandparents</i></p></li></ul><p>Would you explain it the same way? Are there <b>points</b> in <b>common</b> in the way you explain it? Write them down. <br>Try to <b>find</b> the <b>simplest</b> and <b>most</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>way</b> to communicate what you are doing. It’s okay to do a few rounds, try with more friends and more family members. <br><b>Distill</b> your <b>message</b> until you have your <b>perfect</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>pitch</b>.</p>

                        <h3>Step 2: Easy Visuals</h3><p>OK, now you have your project in a <b>clear</b>, <b>simple</b> <b>statement</b>, what’s next? </p><p>At iGEM, teams have to <b>categorize</b> their <b>research</b> into a ‘village’. In the past, this was called tracks - basically <b>potential</b> <b>applications</b> of <b>synthetic</b> <b>biology</b>: medicine, food, sustainability, etc.</p><p>A lot of teams here will use <b>visuals</b> that <b>instantly</b> <b>tie</b> them to their <b>area</b> of <b>work</b>.<br>Working with plants? You will most likely see lots of leaves and greens.<br>Space? It’s grays, blacks, and planets.</p><p>There are <b>obvious</b> <b>visual</b> cues you can use, you want to make it <b>easy</b> for others <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> you. Let’s say you are working with <b>water</b> <b>bioremediation</b>. What do you think of first? Rivers? Waterfalls? Lakes?<br><br>To make sure we have the <b>right</b> <b>words</b>, it’s time for <b>another</b> <b>exercise</b>. <br>Ask your friends and family: What comes to <b>mind</b> when you <b>think</b> of my <b>project</b>?</p><p>Ask for:</p><ul><li><p>Colors</p></li><li><p>Images</p></li><li><p>Keywords</p></li><li><p>Feelings</p></li></ul><p>Find the <b>common</b> <b>patterns</b>. Are any <b>words</b> being <b>repeated</b>? <br>Those might be the <b>easiest</b> <b>identifiers</b> for your work.</p><p>Another good design exercise is to make a <b>little</b> <b>collage</b> by <b>searching</b> for your <b>words</b> and <b>selecting</b> your <b>favorite</b> <b>visuals</b>. Now we’ll use these keywords to choose the <b>color</b> <b>palette</b>. You can use <b>color</b> <b>meanings</b> to make sure you are hitting the right notes. <br>Find <a href="https://www.color-meanings.com/" target="_blank">more information</a> here! </p><p>You don’t have to choose the default green here. There are different <b>online</b> <b>tools</b> and <b>websites</b> to help you find the <b>right</b> <b>shade</b> for your <b>project</b>. I can recommend Pinterest as a great starting point or <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">Coolors</a> if you feel more adventurous.</p>

                        <h3>Step 3: Make It Special</h3><p>Ok, now you have an <b>easy-to-understand</b> project, let’s make it <b>stand</b> <b>out</b>. <br>Make it <b>easy</b> to <b>spot</b> in a sea of hundreds.</p><p><i>Why did you choose this particular field of study?<br>How are you connected to this project?<br>Is there something in your community that ties you to it?</i></p><p>Let other people know - this will give your project a <b>unique</b> <b>flavor</b>.<br>Maybe there is a <b>specific</b> type of <b>bread</b> made with the wheat you are trying to protect.<br>Or the water you are trying to clean comes from a <b>historical</b> <b>source</b> used since the Middle Ages.<br><b>People love stories</b>.</p><p>You can bring this <b>iconic</b> <b>element</b> into the <b>logo</b> or as part of the <b>visuals</b> on the website. It can even help you choose another <b>accent</b> <b>color</b> for your <b>palette</b>. Having that extra meaning is the cherry on top.</p><p>Standing out is key. Two teams working on the <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> will have <b>different</b> <b>approaches</b> to it, especially if they are from different areas of the world. Bioremediation work can mean removing different minerals on one side of the world than on the other. <br><br><b>Highlight</b> that. <b>Problems</b> are <b>global</b>, but <b>solutions</b> can be <b>local</b>.</p>
