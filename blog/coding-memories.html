                        <p>Hi, there!</p>

                        <p>
                            I was walking down memory lane the other day
                            <i
                                >(in my head, I was actually working at a coffee
                                shop)</i
                            >
                            and as I was finishing cleaning up some project
                            documentation, I remembered something.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Back in one of my previous lives, when I used to
                            work for the <b>iGEM foundation</b> and was
                            <b>responsible for maintaining websites</b>, I had
                            to teach myself how to code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While I wouldn’t call myself an <b>engineer</b>, i
                            do consider myself a
                            <b>very technical designer</b> and I’m used to
                            designing and implementing websites. Once I started
                            creating them I got hooked. The more I did it, the
                            more I wanted to do it. I started with
                            <b>html</b> and <b>css</b> and ended up learning
                            <b>javascript</b> and <b>jquery</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Redoing my <b>portfolio website</b> has awakened
                            that <b>coding itch</b> again, and while I keep
                            polishing my <b>front-end skills</b>, I wanted to go
                            back and check a little project I did a few years
                            ago. Ready to look into some <b>old javascript</b>?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let’s review this through a <b>STAR lens</b> meaning
                            → <b>situation</b>, <b>task</b>, <b>actions</b> and
                            <b>results</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>

                        <h3>1) <b>Situation</b></h3>
                        <p>
                            In 2020 a lot of things had to suddenly become
                            <b>remote</b> – you know why, there is no need to
                            repeat it. For <b>iGEM</b> it was the same, the
                            event that was supposed to take place in the
                            <b>Hynes Convention Center</b> and bring together
                            more than
                            <b>300 student teams from all over the world</b> had
                            to pivot quickly to a fully
                            <b>remote experience</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The team hurried to reorganize
                            <b>in-person presentations, workshops and panels</b>
                            into an <b>online agenda</b>. This situation however
                            opened a new opportunity. Since our
                            <b>audience</b> would be tuning in from all over the
                            world, now we had <b>more hours of the day</b> to
                            connect over <b>synbio</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Great! Now our attendees had a
                            <b>richer agenda</b> to choose from. The problem now
                            was making that
                            <b>schedule easy to browse and navigate</b> for all
                            our participants, regardless of <b>time zone</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>Good luck to me, I thought.</p>

                        <p>
                            As the <b>sole designer</b> I was in charge of the
                            <b>visuals</b> and <b>websites</b>, so it landed on
                            my plate to solve this little problem. I set aside a
                            few days to specifically work on it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I started with <b>research</b>. I knew that ideally
                            we needed a <b>quick solution</b> we could have
                            directly on our platform.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Back then I looked at <b>different tools</b> just to
                            make sure I wasn’t reinventing the wheel. There were
                            several <b>paid options</b> we could connect to, but
                            we needed something <b>low cost</b> and tailored to
                            our <b>specific needs</b>. Something
                            <b>flexible</b> that we could update
                            <b>on the day of</b> without any issues. It was time
                            to code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I already had styled the <b>CSS</b> and implemented
                            our sites on <b>MediaWiki</b> and done some
                            <b>JS updates</b> to set up some forms teams had to
                            submit. How hard could this be?
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">

                        <p>Here is the main function of the code!</p>

                        <p>
                            Rereading my code, I'm glad I left comments. I went
                            all out — kind of like this code would be used for
                            years to come and I was going to sell later on. I
                            even considered the cases when a session could end
                            up starting at the end of the month on one side of
                            the world and ending on the next one across the
                            ocean. I think I had a lot of fun doing this...
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>So how did I do it?</b><br />
                            There were <b>3 main things</b> I divided my work
                            into:
                        </p>

                        <div class="spacer-max"></div>

                            style="border: 2px solid #f7eefc"

                        />
                        <h4>Displaying info</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our audience was as diverse as you can get. It not
                            only spanned from
                            <b>diverse backgrounds and cultures</b> but also in
                            <b>age</b>, from high school students to decorated
                            principal investigators — I needed to make things as
                            <b>easy as possible</b> for everyone to reduce
                            friction and make the transition from in-person to
                            digital nicer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I consulted with my team and we came up with
                            <b>3 display formats</b> that varied on information
                            levels:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Minimal</b> = overview was just session
                                titles and an icon for session track organized
                                by day and hour <br />
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Medium</b> = a table, so you can quickly
                                parse everything by scrolling down, just key
                                info<br />
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Detailed</b> = a full list display, included
                                a longer description and all the information we
                                had available for that session
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="spacer-max"></div>

                        <img
                            style="border: 2px solid #f7eefc"
                            src="../assets/blog/coding-memories/sifuentes-coding-memories-2.gif"
                        />

                        <h4>Filtering sessions</h4>

                        <p>
                            Next step was letting them navigate the info
                            depending on their interests. In this specific
                            example they could browse the
                            <b>community sessions</b> based on the
                            <b>type</b> (livestream, workshop, interactive,
                            panel, discussion, etc) and the <b>'track'</b> they
                            belonged to — basically the subject matter
                            (governance, career, education, etc).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If I had more time to clean up the code, I would
                            <b>remove inexistent combinations</b> from the
                            filtering system — for example, there weren't any
                            interactive + governance events — and make sure I
                            display a <b>"no sessions available"</b> message for
                            days that were empty. I would also request our
                            presenters to <b>limit the length</b> of their
                            session titles. Some of them broke the UI but I
                            didn't realize it until it was too late.

                        <h4>Switching between timezones</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is where the fun was. The code
                            <b>sorted and organized</b> all sessions by date and
                            time into the different formats so they were loaded
                            by default. If the user changed the time zone, it
                            would <b>trigger again</b> and reload all the
                            sessions after adjusting the time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It was hard to wrap my head around
                            <b>adding 60 minutes</b> for an hour, so I
                            transformed everything into a format where one hour
                            equals 100. With that logic, I constructed the main
                            function called <b>change_time_zone()</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It took in: <b>month, day, time</b> – when the event
                            happens originally + <b>duration</b> – how long the
                            event lasts and <b>change</b> – the time zone
                            difference in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) that
                            the user had selected from the dropdown (I even
                            added a note for our key timezones: EST, CET, and
                            CST).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With that info, it adjusted the
                            <b>start time</b> and <b>end time</b> by converting
                            the duration (90 minutes turned into 130 in my
                            conversion system).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When minutes went past 60, it corrected that. If the
                            event crossed into the <b>next day</b> it bumped the
                            day forward. If it crossed <b>back a day</b>, it
                            bumped it back.
                        </p>

                            There are other
                            <b>secondary functions</b> referenced from this one
                            — for example, one that has the amount of days in
                            each month to quickly check, and a few others that
                            fix the <b>formatting</b> from military time back to
                            <b>12-hour format</b>.

                            While we didn’t have the scope to measure usage of
                            the tool or do rounds of improvement — working at a
                            <b>non-profit small team</b> during an
                            <b>"unprecedented time"</b> made it very difficult —
                            we received <b>almost no questions</b> in relation
                            to navigating the schedule.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I can confidently say this was
                            <b>very successful</b> in helping our
                            <b>global audience</b>

                        <p>
                            It was also <b>very useful internally.</b> The tool
                            was <b>easily updatable</b> for our team. Being in
                            event logistics, you know things can change minutes
                            before a session starts. So we developed a
                            <b>centralized system</b> to update the info.

                        <p>
                            We had an <b>Excel sheet</b> that the logistics team
                            could keep up to date as a
                            <b>single source of truth</b>. I added a few
                            formulas to <b>merge the text</b> and
                            <b>format it into a single array</b> that I could
                            copy quickly. It was <b>as smooth as butter</b>.

                            I'm happy writing this. This was a very
                            <b>nice project</b> — it was one of my last ones
                            before leaving iGEM to pursue my
                            <b>Master’s degree</b>. I'm very fond of my time at
                            the foundation, I <b>learned so much</b> and got to
                            <b>improve my skills</b> and see outcomes directly.
                            I smile thinking how I would hear from comments how
                            much the <b>community loved</b> both the brand and
                            the websites.

                            While 2020 was <b>challenging</b> (and the years
                            after have also not been a walk in the park), I try
                            to look at the <b>positive side</b> and focus on
                            that <b>silver lining</b>: every challenge is an
                            opportunity to try something new. It also doesn’t
                            have to be a life-changing new thing — it can be a
                            <b>piece of code</b> that brings you a smile years
                            down the line, even if it served its purpose for
                            only a few months and now lives in your
