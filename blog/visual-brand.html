                        <p>
                            Have you ever been in a large crowd trying to find
                            your friends? My eyes aren't super good so I try to
                            look for them by something that stands out:
                            <b>long purple hair</b>, <b>a big blue backpack</b>,
                            <b>a bold cat print</b>.
                            <br />
                            One flash of color in the distance and I know where
                            I need to walk towards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Branding</b> is the same. It's the unique
                            characteristics that make something easy to
                            recognize. Basically every product has a
                            <b>brand</b> nowadays. They go beyond a
                            <b>logo</b> and <b>fancy packaging</b>, modern
                            brands have an <b>online presence</b> with a curated
                            <b>tone of voice</b>. Some brands even have a
                            <b>personality</b> and an
                            <b>unhinged social media presence</b>. Think of the
                            green bird threatening you if you don't practice
                            your German.

                        <p>
                            <b>Murderous owl</b> or not, developing a brand is
                            one of my favorite projects. In fact, I used to earn
                            my bread and butter doing <b>yearly brands</b> (<a
                                href="/work/synbio-branding"

                            >). Selecting <b>keywords</b>, picking
                            <b>colors</b>, testing <b>fonts</b>—it's like
                            creating the rules for your new little world. A new
                            <b>design territory</b> to conquer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            How about we build a <b>brand</b> together? <br />
                            Here? Now? From scratch? <br />
                            Yeah! I say, it will take less than 5 minutes in 4
                            simple steps. <br /><br />Well, kinda. We're
                            breaking down how I built my <b>visual brand</b>,
                            and then you can repeat the steps for your own.
                            Sounds good?
                        </p>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <img
                            src="../assets/blog/visual-brand/sifuentes-visual-brand-1.png"
                        />
                        <p>
                            I'm the loud print. I'm the friend they find thanks
                            bright colors.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <h3>1) Purpose</h3>
                        <p>
                            <b>
                                Before we start, the first question is:
                                <br /><br />
                                What is your brand for?
                            </b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's different if you are developing a
                            <b>personal brand</b> to showcase your
                            <b>professional work</b> vs selling
                            <b>fancy seafood</b>. Yeah, you can use similar
                            colors but your <b>design decisions</b> need to be
                            in favor of the brand's <b>purpose</b>. Also,
                            knowing how your brand will be used will determine
                            what <b>assets</b> you need to create. Your personal
                            brand might not need <b>embroidered napkins</b> with
                            little smiling shrimps. Even if we both think that's
                            a great idea.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let me give you a <b>concrete example</b> — I love
                            <b>bright colors</b> and <b>fun prints</b> for my
                            personal style, but choosing a brand along these
                            lines could <b>distract</b> from my designs. For my
                            use case, I like to think that a good
                            <b>portfolio website</b> should be like a
                            <b>museum</b>. The space has <b>personality</b> but
                            it doesn't detract from the <b>artwork</b>.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">

                            Here is my wardrobe color palette. Maybe we'll see
                            some colors later on?
                        </p>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <h3>2) Keywords</h3>
                        <p>
                            Now we move on to the next question: <br /><br />
                            <b
                                >What words do you want people to associate with
                                your brand?</b
                            >
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As mentioned in my post about
                            <a href="/blog/presentation-style"
                                >finding your presentation style</a
                            >, you can ask <b>friends and family</b> for help.
                            Write down what <b>adjectives</b> people use to
                            describe you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my case I wanted my website to say I am:
                            <b>creative, pragmatic, and fun</b>.
                            <br />
                            All my <b>color</b> and <b>font choices</b> should
                            be aligned with these.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can also write down words that you
                            <b>want</b> people to associate you with.
                            <b>Branding</b> starts with the concept of
                            <b>being something</b>, you can later grow to embody
                            it.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <img
                            src="../assets/blog/visual-brand/sifuentes-visual-brand-3.svg"

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <h3>3) Colors</h3>
                        <p>
                            Now we can finally start getting to <b>visuals</b>,
                            are you excited?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let's do a simple <b>5-color palette</b>. I would
                            recommend picking one <b>accent color</b> first and
                            building the rest around it.
                            <br />
                            How do you choose your first color? With
                            <b>color meanings</b>! You are going to choose one
                            color that people associate with your
                            <b>keywords</b>. Don't worry about the specific
                            shade or saturation, we need a direction first.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are lots of resources online to find color
                            meanings but you can
                            <a href="https://www.color-meanings.com/"
                                >start here</a
                            >
                            browsing some pros and cons for different colors.
                            Once you know what <b>"main color"</b> you want to
                            work with, you can pick a specific version of that
                            color. Think <b>ocre</b> or <b>turquoise</b> instead
                            of just "yellow" or "blue".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my case <b>lilac</b> works great. It's associated
                            with <b>creativity, intuition, innovation</b> and
                            <b>inspiration</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The next color is your <b>complementary color</b>,
                            it's here to help your main color shine and play
                            along with it. It doesn't have to be in the same
                            color family as your main one but it also shouldn't
                            compete with it. Try going for something either
                            <b>lighter</b> or <b>darker</b>. In my case
                            <b>dark purple</b> helps keep in line with the same
                            keywords and adds a bit of contrast.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now it's time for your <b>neutral colors</b>, these
                            are the choir and act as support for the bolder
                            colors. I picked <b>gray, white</b> and
                            <b>black</b>. We are going for <b>clarity</b> and
                            <b>simplicity</b> so these neutral colors will make
                            my purples stand out.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are short on time and need a
                            <b>premade palette</b>, just choose a main color
                            that aligns with your words and search for something

                            One last tip before we move on to the next section!
                            You want to think about <b>accessibility</b>. Are
                            there any <b>color combinations</b> you should
                            avoid? I use
                            <a
                                href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"

                            >. This resource helps me make sure if I use two
                            colors together, most people would be able to
                            <b>read</b> them.

                        <h3>4) Fonts</h3>
                        <p>
                            Now it's time to choose <b>how we write</b>. I would
                            recommend <b>not going above 3 fonts</b>:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>A</b> – for <b>main titles</b> and special
                                messages
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>B</b> – for <b>regular titles</b> and
                                subtitles
                            </li>
                            <li><b>C</b> – for <b>basic paragraphs</b></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Font A can be very <b>wild</b> and <b>stylish</b>,
                            something that stands out and calls for a lot of
                            attention. Font C is <b>reliable</b> and
                            <b>simple</b>, it should be
                            <b>easy to read</b> since most of the text will be
                            in this style. Font B? It's a
                            <b>comfortable in-between</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ok but how are you going to <b>pick fonts</b> in the
                            first place? There are <b>millions</b> out there! In
                            the past I've used
                            <a href="https://www.dafont.com/">dafont.com</a> and
                            searched for <b>free fonts</b>. Nowadays with
                            <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a

                            <b>Pro tip</b>? Try asking ChatGPT for
                            <b>recommendations based on your keywords</b>, it's
                            a good way to start browsing a

                            Now this last tip is not a
                            <b>strictly necessary step</b>, it's the
                            <b>cherry on top</b>.<br />
                            Since we are working on making a
                            <b>nice website</b>, I wanted to focus on some
                            <b>nice extra details</b>. What would make my
                            website special? In my case it's a little bit of
                            <b>animations</b>, adding
                            <b>waves as section dividers</b>, and
                            <b>nice little hover effects</b> on images and
                            links.

                        <p>
                            My brand would still
                            <b>exist without these details</b>, but
                            <b>having them makes it special</b>. It says
                            <b
