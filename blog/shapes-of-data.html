                            I’m knee-deep in the
                            <b>Freeletic’s Transformation Challenge</b>, nearing
                            the <b>halfway</b> point. The finish line seems as
                            close as the start and <b>May</b> can’t come soon
                            enough, but by now, I know <b>I can do it</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Measuring my <b>portions</b>, <b>planning</b>
                            <b>meals</b> in advance, and <b>packing</b>
                            <b>snacks</b> for every outing is second nature.
                            I’ve learned to I have options in my fridge that
                            <b>simplify</b> my <b>decisions</b>, I can simply
                            pick which <b>pre-portioned protein</b> to defrost
                            and turn into the star of my main dish. While all
                            these <b>mental</b> <b>calculations</b> might feel
                            like an <b>extra</b> <b>burden</b> to some (or a
                            blessing for food over thinkers), one thing is
                            <b>clear</b>: I am seeing <b>results</b>. I’ve lost
                            quite a bit of weight, and there are some other side
                            effects I was not expecting from
                            <b>following</b> this specific <b>diet</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wait, aren’t you also <b>working out</b>? Yes, I’m
                            also training hard! But tracking <b>fitness</b>
                            <b>progress</b> is a bit trickier. I don’t test
                            <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>pull-ups</b> I can do
                            first thing in the morning. (Although my trainer
                            would love that idea, so let’s keep this quiet.)

                            Instead, let’s take a look at the <b>data</b> I have
                            been collecting and how some <b>simple</b>
                            <b>visualizations</b> are helping me
                            <b>understand my</b> <b>progress</b> in a new way.

                        <p>
                            If you know me or have come across my blog before,
                            you know <b>I’m a</b> bit <b>obsessive</b> and
                            <b>love</b> <b>organizing</b> things. So, it won’t
                            come as a <b>surprise</b> that I have a
                            <b>spreadsheet</b> where I track all my meals. (You
                            can read more about it here:
                            <a
                                href="https://anasifuentes.com/blog/transformationchallenge"

                        <p>
                            On this same spreadsheet, I also track my
                            <b>weight, body fat percentage, </b>and<b>
                                water levels</b
                            >—plus total <b>calories consumed per day</b> and
                            <b>estimated meal costs</b>. I keep adding more data
                            and over time, this has evolved into a
                            <b><i>beautiful</i> <i>database</i></b> with an
                            <b>ingredient</b> list that includes
                            <b>costs </b>and<b> calories</b>,
                            <b>meal breakdowns</b> for easy comparisons, and my
                            favorite: <b>data visualizations</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To keep this database up to date, I
                            <b>weigh</b> myself <b>every</b> <b>day</b> and log
                            the data every few days. Sometimes, I even
                            <b>plan meals </b>in<b> advance</b> to help me use
                            up leftovers and
                            <b>reduce food waste</b>.<br /><br />Do these
                            <b>daily</b> <b>measurements</b> pay off? Yes. How?
                            We have some <b>trends</b> to look at!

                            I started this program in January, and it’s now
                            March. That means I’ve been doing the
                            <b>bootcamp</b> for <b>64</b> <b>days</b> straight.
                            How does this look in practice? Let’s use some dots
                            to find out.

                            Each <b>orange</b> dot represents a <b>day</b>. The
                            <b>outlined</b> <b>dots</b> mark days when I
                            <b>missed</b> <b>recording</b> my weight but still
                            followed everything else in the plan. (At the start,
                            I hadn’t decided to track everything, but that
                            quickly changed.)

                            I work out four times per week. On
                            <b>Tuesdays</b> and <b>Thursdays</b>, I have to
                            <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> very <b>early</b> to join the
                            team trainings. Let’s mark these days with a
                            <b>purple</b> <b>star</b>. I’m not the biggest fan
                            of early mornings, so I’m giving myself a star for
                            accomplishing that.

                            impact my weight? That week will be outlined with a

                            <b>62 kg,</b> and the week just before starting, it
                            was 61.8 kg. I felt pretty healthy, but I

                            <b>goal</b>,I just wanted to see how far I could go.
                            <br />After discussing it with Sina, we decided I
                            should aim to be between 53–55 kg. I set my
                            <b>goal</b> at <b>53 kg</b>, ensuring my
                            <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> would be <b>low</b> while

                            there’s also a noticeable pattern: my <b>weight</b>
                            <b>loss</b> <b>isn’t</b> <b>linear</b>. There are

                            The challenge doesn’t explicitly ask us to
                            <b>weigh</b> ourselves <b>every</b> <b>day</b>, but
                            me being me, I wasn’t going to pass up the chance to
                            track it in a spreadsheet. But what would have
                            happened if I had <b>only</b> <b>checked</b> the
                            scale <b>when</b> I thought I <b>needed</b> to?

                            Looking at only the <b>check-in days</b>, I would
                            have missed all the in-between changes! The line
                            chart fluctuates quite a bit between those points.
                            There’s also a clear <b>pattern</b>: I tend to
                            <b>weigh</b> <b>more</b> on <b>Thursdays</b> than on
                            Mondays. This could be influenced by having to
                            <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>early</b> on Thursdays
                            compared to a slightly later start on Mondays. Even
                            though I’m more rested at the start of the week, my
                            <b>lowest</b> <b>weigh</b>-<b>ins</b> still happen
                            on <b>weekends</b>, maybe because I’m more relaxed
                            before the new week begins.

                            Could there be <b>another</b>
                            <b>factor</b> affecting my weight? Maybe something
                            happens at <b>certain</b> <b>time</b> of the
                            <b>month</b>… let’s check.

                            Adding the days when I have my <b>period</b> (marked
                            in <b>lilac</b> <b>columns</b>) reveals a
                            <b><i>possible</i></b> <b>pattern</b>. In
                            <b>February</b>, my <b>weight</b> started
                            <b>going</b> <b>up</b> the week before my period,
                            staying steady before dropping again. In
                            <b>March</b>, though, the pattern was <b>all</b>
                            <b>over</b> the place. There might be some
                            influence, but the <b>data</b> is<b> inconclusive</b

                            There are also some <b>positive</b> <b>side</b>
                            <b>effects</b> that are hard to measure. My
                            <b>skin</b> looks much nicer now. I’ve always taken
                            pride in my skin (My mom told me to care for it
                            since I was 12. ¡Gracias, Mami! ) and I’ve been
                            lucky with <b>good</b> <b>genetics</b>, backed by a
                            solid <b>nighttime</b> <b>routine</b>. But lately?
                            It’s <b>so</b> <b>soft</b>. Even my own high
                            standards are impressed. This could be from
                            <b>cutting</b> out <b>refined</b> <b>sugar</b> and
                            sticking to a strict diet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another unexpected change is that I’m
                            <b>sleeping</b> <b>less</b>. I feel <b>more</b>
                            <b>energized</b>. Maybe it’s the habit of
                            <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> early <b>twice</b> a
                            <b>week</b>, but on days when I’d usually sleep in
                            until noon, I’m up and about by 9 AM.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m really happy with these <b>visualizations</b>.
                            Weighing myself every day can be a bit annoying,
                            borderline obsessive, but it has shown me that
                            <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>isn’t</b>
                            <b>linear</b>. Many factors affect daily changes. If
                            you want to be <i>really</i> extreme, you can even
                            see the <b>difference</b> a few glasses of
                            <b>water</b> make before stepping on the
                            <b>scale</b>. Sometimes, <b>weight</b> follows
                            simple <b>science</b>: calories in, calories out.
                            Other times, there are “<b>magical</b>” things
                            happening in the background.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So <b>instead</b> of <b>obsessing</b> over numbers,
                            despite what my spreadsheet habits might suggest, I
                            try to look at the <b>bigger</b> <b>picture</b>. The
                            <b>overall</b> <b>trend</b> is <b>good</b>. I can be
                            happy with that. Working on an <b>obesity</b>
                            <b>project</b> (<a

                            >!) a few years ago also shaped my perspective.
                            <b>Weight</b> and <b>health</b> are <b>more</b> than
                            just <b>numbers</b>. <b>Hormones</b>, <b>stress</b>,
                            <b>medication</b>, and <b>genetics</b> all
                            <b>play</b> a <b>role</b>. Even if <b>diet</b> and
                            <b>exercise</b> are in check, fluctuations are
                            normal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I can use myself as an example. I’m strict with my
                            routine, and these ups and downs
                            <i>still</i> happen, it’s normal and it shouldn’t
                            impact my overall progress.

                            <b>yourself</b>.
