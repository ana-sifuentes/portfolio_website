                            where Iâ€™d have to measure all my meals, avoid all
                            alcohol, and do intense workouts for the next

                            you love wine."

                            Yes. Iâ€™m obsessed with good food and good wine. But
                            I had done the <b>workout</b> portion of the

                            After a few months, I was able to do my first clean
                            pull-up. I wanted more.

                            I'm three weeks in, and
                            <b>it hasnâ€™t been so bad</b>. Yes, on the first day
                            of the program, I was coming back from visiting my
                            brother in Paris and had to ignore the smell of
                            croissants as I weighed my food on the train. And
                            yes, I have to wake up at 5:45 a.m. on training days
                            and wait in the snow for my S-Bahn. But the results
                            are already starting to showâ€”Iâ€™ve been losing around
                            <b>1 kg per week</b>, and my goal of two
                            <b>back-to-back pull-ups</b> feels within reach.

                            But beyond the physical benefits, this program has
                            given me something else. <br />A surprise gift, in

                            Since I have to follow a strict dietâ€”measuring all

                            This turned out to be the <b>perfect</b>
                            <b>framework</b> to not only to get creative with my

                            <b>costs</b>. So, when I found myself with a bit of
                            free time this weekend, I cracked open a
                            zero-calorie soda and got to work on Google Sheets.
                            I started by adding my daily metrics then logged
                            everything I had eaten over the past three weeks
                            using the photos Iâ€™d been taking. Next, I created an
                            ingredient list to calculate how much each meal
                            would cost.

                        <p>
                            Soon, I was researching how to call different search
                            methods between tabs in Excel to <b>build</b> my
                            little <b>database</b>. For <b>calorie amounts</b>,
                            I referenced a few nutrition sites Iâ€™ve used in the
                            past. For <b>prices</b>, I pulled data from my local
                            supermarketâ€™s ordering system. A few hours in, I had
                            compiled all my <b>data</b> into an
                            <b>easy-to-update system</b>.

                            <br /><b>Vegetarian</b> <b>meals</b> are the
                            <b>cheapest</b>. A good pasta with crushed tomato
                            sauce and mozzarella will only cost you
                            <b>â‚¬1.51</b>, while my "luxury" meals involve
                            shrimp. You can see my Mexican excess when I make a
                            low-calorie version of
                            <em>Tostadas de CamarÃ³n</em> (shrimp in green sauce
                            served over corn waffles). That one costs me
                            <b>~â‚¬4.52</b>, still cheaper than any Mexican
                            restaurant in Munich. Snacks and breakfasts are the
                            most affordable, with most of them just above
                            <b>â‚¬1 per portion</b>.

                            One of my goals this year is to <b>save</b>
                            <b>money</b>â€”<em>probably yours too</em>â€”so meal
                            costs are a big deal. Iâ€™m already saving by

                            (Iâ€™m a fiend for a good oat flat white). While I
                            have a rough idea of how much I spent on food before
                            this diet, Iâ€™m afraid to check my bank statements
                            and see just how much Iâ€™ve contributed to Munichâ€™s

                            The total cost of my meals is below this national
                            average, which makes me quite happy. Fresh,
                            high-quality ingredients <em>below</em> the national
                            spending level? Nice!

                            The biggest advantage of my system is how
                            <b>easy</b> it is to <b>implement</b> and
                            <b>update</b>. Iâ€™m running into one issue, though.
                            Handling half or double portions. For example, my
                            evening snack is Skyr with two portions of fat. I
                            usually pick double chocolate for something
                            <em>almost</em> like stracciatella ice cream (Trust
                            me on this. Add a little no-calorie sweetener and a
                            pinch of salt). So far my <b>solution</b> has been
                            to create an ingredient called â€˜Double dark
                            chocolateâ€™. But I donâ€™t think this is best practice.

                            I thought about building the database in Python,
                            which would give me more flexibility with portions
                            and calculations, but updating it on the go would be
                            harder. Google Sheets is just more convenient since
                            I can access it anywhere. For now, Iâ€™ll keep
                            updating the spreadsheet while brainstorming ways to
                            improve it in the background. Iâ€™m also planning to
                            experiment with some fun data visualizationsâ€”more to
                            come!
