                            While I like organizing things, the idea really took
                            shape when Pinterest first showed me capsule

                            <b>52-piece year-round wardrobe</b>. I‚Äôve always had
                            a minimalist side‚ÄîI don‚Äôt like owning too many
                            things, and clutter makes my skin crawl‚Äîso the idea
                            of having a small number of high-quality pieces I
                            could mix and match seemed like a dream.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, I started a little design project. Complete with
                            all it‚Äôs phases:
                            <b>researching, testing, iterating, prototyping, </b

                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-2-2">
                        <p>
                            My goals were clear:
                            <b>look good, love my clothes, </b>and<b>
                                keep the total number of items low.</b
                            >
                            I started with <b>research</b>. I read plenty of
                            articles and watched YouTube videos to learn as much
                            as I could. What colors suit my complexion with
                            seasonal color analysis, how to take measurements to
                            determine my shape type, and even a deep dive into
                            Kibbe body types to align my wardrobe with my
                            personality (I‚Äôm somewhere between a romantic and a
                            gamine, if you want to know).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over time, I started <b>noticing</b>
                            <b>trends</b>‚Äîwhat colors looked best on me, what
                            patterns I was naturally drawn to. I also made
                            mental notes whenever friends complimented my outfit
                            or when a stranger asked where I got something.
                            These helped me define the <b>iterations</b> and
                            curation process for my wardrobe. The current
                            version hasn‚Äôt changed much in the last two years,
                            so we‚Äôve finally arrived at a <b>mature product.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the same time, I was trying to keep track of what
                            I owned in some sort of system. I
                            <b>tested</b> several software solutions‚ÄîNotion,
                            Illustrator, Miro‚Äîbefore finally settling on
                            <b>Figma.</b> As a designer, it was the easiest tool
                            for me to manipulate, gave me the most freedom, and
                            I could access it on almost any device. I even
                            <b>experimented</b> with some
                            <b>visualizations</b> on an older version of my
                            closet, back when I lived in Boston and wore way
                            more blues and greens. Most days now, you‚Äôll find me
                            in red or purple<b>.</b> People change.

                        <p>
                            For my first closet visualization, I illustrated
                            each piece in vectors. It was fun, but painfully
                            time-consuming. This time around, I went for a more
                            <b>efficient</b> <b>approach</b>: photos. I used
                            official product photos when I bought something new,
                            searched for similar pieces online to screen grab,
                            or just took pictures at home against a white
                            background.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once I had everything in Figma, I <b>mapped</b> out
                            the <b>colors</b> I was wearing the most to develop
                            a <b>personal</b> color <b>palette</b>. Then, I
                            labeled everything and divided it into
                            sections‚Äîclothing categories like outerwear, shoes,
                            tops, and bottoms, and color groups like neutrals,
                            complementary tones, and accents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this setup, I could also group clothes by
                            season and create <i>micro-capsules</i>. These
                            turned out to be incredibly useful for travel
                            planning, packing outfits based on weather
                            conditions, and for storing off-season clothes.<br />I
                            even added a bit of <b>data</b>
                            <b>visualization</b>. Pieces got an outline based on
                            their status: green if I‚Äôm making it, orange if it
                            needs tailoring, etc.<br />

                            love showing it to friends, and some of them also
                            have their own frameworks to organize their closets.

                            sticking to a ‚Äúreplace, don‚Äôt add‚Äù and a good
                            portion of my clothes are secondhand. My closet also
                            has <b>range</b>‚Äî one end a <b>solid</b>
