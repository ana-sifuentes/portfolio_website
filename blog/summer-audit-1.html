                        <p>
                            Hey, it's <b>summer</b> in the northern hemisphere –
                            at least that's what I think.<br />
                            Companies are rolling out their
                            <b>pre-fall campaigns</b> and reminding me of the
                            <b>50% off</b> from the summer collection.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Pre-fall?</b> I haven't even dipped my feet into
                            the river...
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, to cheer us up and focus on the
                            <i>~summer vibes~</i> we are going to do a
                            <b>summer closet audit</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Does that mean <b>organizing</b> and
                            <b>planning</b>? Yes, yes it does. That's how we
                            relax around these parts. That's what you come to
                            this blog for, no? Putting things in their
                            <b>right place</b> so your brain goes "<i
                                >mmm... nice!</i
                            >".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Besides, sorting our <b>summer pieces</b> will
                            create a natural <b>capsule wardrobe</b>, perfect if
                            you are taking a mini holiday trip and getting your
                            very deserved time in the sun.

                        <h3>Methodology</h3>

                        <p>
                            Ok, we already know we’re focusing on <b>summer</b>,
                            but let’s narrow down our scope even further for a
                            thorough review. Let's look at my
                            <b>basic pieces</b>, meaning:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Tops</b></li>
                            <li><b>Bottoms</b></li>
                            <li><b>Shoes</b></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            What about my <b>one-pieces</b> (dresses, rompers),
                            <b>accessories</b>, and <b>layers</b>? We’ll leave
                            those for <b>next week</b>. Why? This week we’re
                            going to try to <b>maximize combinations</b> for
                            packing and <b>efficiency</b> purposes. Even if I
                            also mix and match my dresses, most of the time I
                            wear them as a <b>single item</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We’ll also leave out my <b>workout outfits</b>, note
                            this is different than my <b>sporty</b> tag we’ll
                            see below. These clothes are focused on me going all
                            out during a workout session, not going for a cute,
                            chill bike ride.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, do we need any <b>subcategories</b>? I don’t
                            think so, but we can have some helpful
                            <b>tags</b> like:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Fancy</b></li>
                            <li><b>Sporty</b></li>
                            <li><b>Formal</b></li>
                            <li><b>Casual</b></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            These <b>tags</b> can help me pick outfits depending
                            on the <b>occasion</b>: <b>date night</b> with my
                            favorite engineer,
                            <b>walking coffee catch-up</b> with the girlies, or
                            an <b>important business presentation</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One final thing for our audit: we’ll use my
                            <b>Figma file</b> I mentioned in my
                            <a href="/blog/figma-fashion"
                                >Figma fashion article</a
                            >. That way, we can put together some example
                            outfits without me jumping in and out of clothes too
                            much.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let’s take a look at what we have. I’ve gathered my
                            <b>tops</b>, <b>bottoms</b>, and <b>shoes</b> for
                            summer, and I added <b>tags</b> for each of them.
                            Yes, I created everything as <b>components</b> on
                            Figma. Product design tricks that stick forever (<a
                                href="/blog/system-love"
                                >read about design systems here</a
                            >, wink!).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As you can see, some items have more than one
                            <b>tag</b>. I think it would depend on how I
                            <b>mix and match</b> to determine the final
                            classification of the outfit. We'll review this in
                            the next steps.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <b>color palette</b> is a subset of my general
                            one. Mostly we have <b>neutrals</b>, which is great
                            for a set of <b>basics</b>. Next, we have a few of
                            my <b>complementary colors</b> and a few
                            <b>accents</b>. Good balance so far.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <i>Note:</i> I counted a piece in
                            <b>several colors</b> if it came in more than one,
                            for example those Farm Rio shorts with hearts are in
                            black, cream, and cherry.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If we look at the <b>colors by frequency</b> in the
                            graph below, we can see there’s a lot of great
                            potential for <b>mixing and matching</b>. Let’s
                            start calculating all of our <b>combinations</b>,
                            shall we?
                        </p>

                        <h3>2) Analysis</h3>

                        <p>
                            If I have <b>9 tops</b>, <b>6 bottoms</b>, and
                            <b>4 pairs of shoes</b>, the possible outfit
                            combinations are <b>9 × 6 × 4 = 216</b>. That's
                            pretty impressive! But in practice, there are two
                            factors to consider:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A) Not all combinations really
                            <b>work visually</b> with my clothes—and that's
                            okay. We want <b>variety</b>, but also
                            <b>cohesion</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            B) I don’t count switching shoes as a different
                            outfit. It just <b>inflates the numbers</b>.
                            Changing shoes feels more like <b>styling</b>—like
                            when you're exploring a new city and want to
                            <b>dress up for dinner</b>. We’ll look at styling
                            options like this in a future blog.
                            <b>Stay tuned!</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Back to <b>calculations</b>: if we’re being more
                            realistic, the actual outfit combinations come
                            closer to around <b>54</b>. But we still need to
                            narrow that number down, since some combinations
                            just <b>don’t feel right</b> to me.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If we lay out all the clothes by top and highlight
                            the <b>combinations that work</b>, we end up with
                            about <b>40 different outfits</b>. Not bad after
                            editing things down, right?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now that we’ve mapped out all possible
                            <b>combinations</b>, let’s pick a few
                            <b>highlights</b> to see the
                            <b>capsule wardrobe</b> in action.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here are a few <b>scenarios</b> and a couple of
                            <b>outfit options</b> for each of them:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>1 – Walking around a new city</b> –
                                <i>casual</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>2 – Running errands on a bike</b> –
                                <i>sporty</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>3 – Important remote work call</b> –
                                <i>formal</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>4 – Anniversary dinner</b> – <i>fancy</i>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            What do you think? Would you suggest any other
                            <b>combinations</b>? I feel like this
                            <b>scenario exercise</b> is the adult/designer
                            version of <b>playing dress-up</b>. It’s both
                            <b>practical</b> and <b>fun</b>!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As the <b>auditor</b>, I’d say we had a very
                            <b>successful review</b>; out of those
                            <b>40 combinations</b>, there are some I hadn’t
                            considered before. Doing a
                            <b>thorough review</b> helped me
                            <b>expand my style options</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>Let’s wrap it up with some <b>conclusions</b>.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <img
                            src="../assets/blog/summer-audit-1/sifuentes-summer-audit-1-5.png"
                        />
                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <p>
                            <i><b>"There are no rules in fashion."</b></i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This statement might seem a bit contradictory—yes, I
                            love expressing myself through clothes, but I have a
                            constant desire to <b>organize</b> things. I think
                            this little <b>audit</b> showcases how these two
                            things can <b>coexist</b> together. Having a
                            <b>template</b> that gives you a
                            <b>sandbox to be creative</b> works wonders for me.
                            A fun mix of <b>colorful prints</b> and
                            <b>basics</b> will help you create your own
                            <b>style guidelines</b> and give you enough room to
                            play.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My <b>audit today</b> was pretty straightforward. My
                            closet is already narrowed down—if I don’t wear
                            something too often or don’t even consider it for
                            trips, I place it on hold for a few months. Later,
                            when I do a <b>closet cleanup</b> and I don’t miss
                            it, then it’s time to find it a <b>new home</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One angle I didn’t consider this time was the
                            <b>price</b> of items and <b>sustainability</b>. For
                            basics, I’d recommend trying to get pieces
                            <b>second-hand</b>. I can get
                            <b>high-quality stuff</b> fairly cheap. Note: high
                            quality doesn’t have to be top-shelf pieces—even
                            some <b>"fast fashion gems"</b> will be pretty
                            reliable. My <b>denim</b> and <b>shorts</b> are
                            actually second-hand Primark—surprise! Once I find a
                            brand and size that fits me, I’ll look for it on
                            <b>Vinted</b>, where another girlie will likely have
                            just what I’m looking for.
                        </p>

                            <b>Summer Audit 1: Completed! ✅</b><br />
                            The <b>summer capsule wardrobe</b> is ready for the
                            next trip—hopefully before fall arrives... And while
                            I usually don’t overpack, if I’m going on holiday I
                            want to wear all my pretty dresses— so we’ll see
                            them on the next <b>audit session</b>.

                            Until next time, I hope this worked as a little
                            <b>organization</b> / <b>styling inspo</b>. It
                            definitely did for me.
