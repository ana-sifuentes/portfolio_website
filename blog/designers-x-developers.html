                            front-end programmers, we had managed to convince
                            the meetup organizers to center the talks on the
                            intersection of <b>design</b> and
                            <b>code</b>, and how

                            In my humble opinion, the event was a great success!
                            Around <b>50 people</b> joined us at the
                            <b>Freeletics</b> office for an evening of

                        <h3>Preparation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The whole event started when I approached
                            <b>Laura</b> and
                            <b>Michael</b> at the office, wondering if
                            there was a way we could host an event to help us
                            <b>network</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Michael had an idea instantly—the
                            <b>TypeScript meetup</b>. Even though it
                            wasn’t an obvious fit for us on the creative side,
                            we could propose a <b>joint event</b> that
                            connected <b>designers </b>and<b>
                                developers</b>. We work together on the same projects and achieve
                            great results, so why not share our experience with
                            other <b>interdisciplinary teams</b>?
                            After a few messages and a solid pitch to the
                            <b>TypeScript organizers</b>, the event
                            was set.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the weeks leading up to the meetup, we divided
                            tasks and organized logistics.
                            <b>Michael</b> focused on communications
                            with our <b>external collaborators</b>,
                            while <b>Laura</b> managed to convince me
                            <i>not</i> to cook for 50+ people (thank you,
                            Laura, and thank you, Domino’s
                            <b>Pizza</b>, for saving my hands).
                            Meanwhile, Laura and I worked on the
                            <b>presentation</b> together.

                            A few days before the event,
                            <b>Laura</b> shared some of her
                            <b>ideas</b> on what we could discuss.
                            From there, I turned her

                            Let’s cut to the chase. The truth is
                            <b>pixel-perfect</b> is a

                            should remember:

                            they don’t understand your design, no one will. Ask
                            your team how they prefer handoff as it speeds up
                            the process and makes them feel heard. You can use
                            ceremonies as <b>user research</b>. Keep
                            in mind how
                            <b>developers interact</b> with your

                            <b>pain points</b> in your workflow. Every
                            interaction is an opportunity to

                            In the first week of March, <b>my</b>

                            >, and I—had the pleasure of
                            <b>hosting</b> the latest
                            <b>TypeScript</b> <b>meetup</b>.
                            The focus this time? <b>User</b>
                            <b>Experience</b>.<br />Despite the meetup
                            group’s main purpose of sharing tech insights for
                            front-end programmers, we had managed to convince
                            the meetup organizers to center the talks on the
                            intersection of <b>design</b> and
                            <b>code</b>, and how
                            <b>collaboration</b> helps deliver the
                            <b>best</b> <b>product</b> for
                            our users.

                        <p>
                            In my humble opinion, the event was a great success!
                            Around <b>50 people</b> joined us at the
                            <b>Freeletics</b> office for an evening of
                            <b>networking</b>, interesting
                            <b>discussions</b>, silly
                            <b>ice breakers</b>, and, the key to all
                            meetups, <b>pizza</b>.

                        <p>
                            Now, I want to focus on the <b>talk</b> we
                            gave: a quick guide on how to
                            <b>improve collaboration</b>
                            between<b> designers</b> and
                            <b>developers</b>. Let's dive into Laura's

<h3>5. Focusing on the Final User</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is <b>your north star</b>. <br />It
                            <b>doesn’t matter</b> if you love the
                            design or think the code could be flashier. What
                            <b>matters</b> is that the
                            <b>final user</b> understands it and has a
                            <b>pleasant experience</b>. Always
                            <b>design and build for them.</b>
                        </p>

                            You don’t have to ‘understand’ each other’s magic
                            but you have to respect it.

                            The meetup was a <b>success</b> because
                            everything was set up to give us the best possible
                            odds of making it happen. We received
                            <b>great</b> <b>advice</b> from
                            a <b>colleague</b> on how to best use our
                            space for meetups, <b>prepared</b>
                            <b>logistics</b> well in advance, and
                            coordinated with our office team to ensure
                            everything was in top shape. We kept our
                            <b>planning</b> <b>simple</b>,
                            organizing <b>to-do lists</b> around one
                            key question:
                            <b><i>What will people do when they arrive?</i></b>
                            <br />And throughout the process, we
                            <b>communicated</b>
                            <b>often</b> to keep everything running
                            smoothly.

                        <p>
                            During the event, our colleagues went above and
                            beyond—from handling small
                            <b>last-minute errands</b> to staying late
                            to help us <b>clean</b>
                            <b>up</b>. A <b>meetup</b> is
                            made <i>for</i> the <b>attendees</b>,
                            but it’s also made <i>by</i> the
                            <b>team</b> that works behind the scenes
                            to bring it to <b>life</b>.

                            I’m incredibly <b>grateful</b> to
                            <b>everyone</b> who attended, listened to
                            our talk, and helped make the night a success. You
