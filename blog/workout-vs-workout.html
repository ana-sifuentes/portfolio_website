                            ><br /><em>Are you getting enough back?</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <br />In general, I consider myself a fairly sporty
                            person.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That being said, I like being
                            <b>active</b> but I <b>prefer</b> some
                            <b>workouts</b>
                            <b>better</b> than others. <br />I can
                            <b>walk</b> for <b>hours</b> and if you add a good
                            conversation and a hot drink in my hand, I can go to
                            the ends of the earth. <b>Cycling</b> is also a
                            pretty easy sell for me, nice weather and the
                            perfect playlist make me feel like I am in a movie.
                            I'm the protagonist riding happy and free.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, if you try convincing me to go for a
                            <b>swim</b>, it's like bathing a cat. <b>No</b> one
                            is going to like it and I'm going to try to cling to
                            the shore desperately.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think I'm <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in my
                            <b>preferences</b>. You might also rather give it
                            your all on the <b>dance</b> <b>floor</b>
                            <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> endless sets of
                            <b>burpees</b>, jumping squats and diamond pushups.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's just some workouts feel easier than others.<br />So,
                            let's actually compare them.<br />If I have an
                            <b>hour</b> per <b>day</b> to be <b>active</b>, how
                            should I <b>spend</b> it?
                            <br />

                            Studies show that being in <b>nature</b> has lots of

                            I don‚Äôt need a leisurely stroll through the Alps.
                            Sometimes a <b>night</b> <b>walk</b> and a nice
                            <b>catch-up phone call</b> with my mom is more than
                            enough. However, being from Latin America gives me a
                            bit of extra nuance here. There might be
                            <b>areas</b> of the city you live in, or times of
                            the day, when it‚Äôs <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> to go for

                            Lifting <b>weights</b> helps you <b>build</b>
                            <b>muscle</b> <b>mass</b>, which is
                            <b>crucial</b> the <b>older</b> you get, as this
                            <b>diminishes</b> with age. Also, thinking in the
                            long term, <b>lifting</b> can help you
                            <b>develop</b> <b>strong</b> <b>bones</b> and help
                            with <b>weight</b> <b>management</b>, as muscle
                            needs more energy than fat.

                            Nowadays you <b>don‚Äôt</b> even <b>need</b> a
                            <b>gy</b>m to train, as you can use many
                            <b>fitness</b> <b>apps</b> or even browse online for
                            some <b>free</b> <b>routines</b>. If you‚Äôre
                            creative, you can also <b>skip</b> some of the
                            <b>weights</b>. I‚Äôve done sessions at home with a
                            <b>few</b> <b>kilos</b> of <b>rice</b>, just make
                            sure you can <b>grip</b> them <b>easily</b> to avoid
                            picking up grains for days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are <b>new</b> to <b>weights</b>, I would
                            recommend you <b>check</b> <b>in</b> with a personal
                            trainer a few times to get the
                            <b>proper</b>
                            <b>technique</b> and <b>avoid</b> <b>injury</b>.
                            Maybe try going to your local gym for extra tips.
                            Also, depending on how hard you train, expect
                            <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b>, so I would also
                            <b>recommend</b> <b>adding</b> some
                            <b>stretching</b> and <b>aerobic</b> <b>cardio</b>
                            <b>sessions</b> to give some love back to your

                            because their dance videos kept me
                            <b>sane</b> during the <b>pandemic</b>. This could
                            be due to a recent study finding
                            <b>dancing</b> equal to, and sometimes even more

                            have to admit that I <b>walk</b> kinda <b>fast</b>.
                            I grew up <b>mimicking</b> my <b>mom‚Äôs</b>

                            <b>I‚Äôm Latin American</b>, and I don‚Äôt know how not
                            to give it my all while dancing. It is my burden to
                            bear, but I have to represent my region by
                            <b>showing</b> <b>off</b> the
                            <b>forbidden</b>

                        <p>
                            One thing that is super important! Do remember that
                            we <b>might</b> <b>burn</b>
                            <b>calories</b>
                            <b>differently</b>.<br />For reference, I
                            <b>weigh</b> around <b>55kg</b> and my
                            <b>height</b> is <b>1.57m</b>. The amount of
                            <b>calories</b> you <b>burn</b> will
                            <b>depend</b> on how <b>much</b> <b>effort</b> your
                            <b>body</b> has to do to make you move, so calories
                            will change if we are different sizes. The
                            <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to know is to <b>measure</b>
                            <b>yourself</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now what? <br />It‚Äôs <b>time</b> for <b>you</b> to
                            <b>pick</b> your
                            <b>favorite</b>
                            <b>activity</b> and get moving.<br /><br />Maybe
                            we‚Äôll run into each other on a <b>sunny</b>
                            <b>path</b> or have to go face to face on the
