                            Do you
                            <b>love putting things in their right place</b>? Is

                        <h3>1) Get comfortable</h3>

                        <p>
                            Let's learn to love the design system. The first
                            step is to
                            <b>get comfortable with what you’re working with</b>
                            and design a few screens. Here there are two
                            scenarios: is there already a set of rules, or do
                            you have to make them?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If there is an <b>existing design system</b>, play
                            with the components — give yourself a simple task.
                            Try a <b>3-screen flow</b> you can sketch in an
                            afternoon. Ask questions to the other designers and
                            developers.
                            <b>Understand how colors and fonts work</b> in the
                            product you’re working with. Working within a
                            framework may feel limiting, but it is
                            <b>giving you direction</b>. Think of what you
                            create as a piece that should
                            <b>fit in the ecosystem</b>. Make it feel
                            <b>natural and not out of place</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now if you have to <b>start from scratch</b>, there
                            is infinite room to play — but also a lot more
                            decisions to be made. The recommendation still
                            stands: <b>start by designing a simple flow</b>. By
                            this point, I’m assuming you already have a brand
                            with some basic guidelines (if you need tips on
                            making one, you can
                            <a href="/blog/visual-brand">check out this blog</a
                            >), so start putting those colors to action.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Want to add another layer of complexity?
                            <b>Hell yeah, let’s go!</b><br />
                            Ok, so the next level is to
                            <b
                                >turn the screens you designed from light mode
                                to dark mode</b
                            >
                            — for those users who prefer darker screens or work
                            late into the night. Here you will need
                            <b>color equivalents</b> and start thinking about
                            <b>hierarchy</b>: What color is your
                            <b>primary background</b>? What color is the
                            <b>content on top of it</b>? How does that color
                            <b>change when we switch to dark mode</b>?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Try some tests and start <b>drafting your rules</b>.
                            Once you are happy with how things look — and
                            double-checked the contrast so your design is
                            <b>accessible</b> — we are ready for the next tip.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <img
                            src="../assets/blog/system-love/sifuentes-system-love-2.svg"
                        />
                        <p>
                            Primary background color definitions in dark and
                            light mode
                        </p>

                        <h3>2) Make everyone comfortable</h3>

                        <p>
                            Once we have <b>good rules</b> and
                            <b>tested out colors and fonts</b>, we can start
                            writing about your designs. Get your pens out — it’s
                            time to write! But before you put digital text to
                            digital paper, you have to ask yourself:
                            <b>Who is your design system for?</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You might think it’s only for developers using their
                            developer magic to turn your designs into reality —
                            but it’s really for <b>everyone</b>. Other designers
                            will also use your components to create screens,
                            content writers will work within the space you give,
                            and the localization team will make sure that text
                            is ready in other languages. <br /><br />
                            So, <b>what should we add to the documentation?</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let’s start with the basics: <b>colors</b> for
                            backgrounds, fonts, content, and different statuses
                            (enabled or disabled).
                            <b>Padding and size specs</b> are also essential for
                            the implementation team. If you have all of this —
                            congrats! You have a
                            <b>nicely documented component</b>. Can we add a few
                            cherries on top? Yes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Think of how your component will be used. When
                            should we use a <b>primary surface</b> vs a
                            <b>secondary one</b>? When is the
                            <b>secondary button</b> a better option than the
                            primary one?
                            <b>Giving some rules and examples</b> for your
                            design team — and honestly for yourself too — will
                            come in handy to maintain consistency and when
                            making decisions further down the line.
                            <br />
                            For example, if you’re giving feedback to your team
                            to use a different version of the component, you can
                            <b>reference the design system</b> to make sure
                            we’re keeping everything in line.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another cherry? <b>Add details for content</b>.
                            Yum!<br /><br />
                            Having worked on the writing side of design (plus
                            dealing with localization), there are a few extra
                            notes you can add here. If it’s an element with
                            text, you can add <b>character limits</b> and
                            <b>usage suggestions</b> for copy. How do you want
                            the content designer to fill in the text here? Can
                            this button handle being more than one line?
                            <b
                                >Those are extra questions your documentation
                                can answer</b
                            >. Plus, the localization teams will love you if you
                            add <b>extra notes and examples</b> for other
                            languages.

                            My last tip is what helped me
                            <b>refine my systems</b> the most — it was
                            <b>talking to developers</b>. I've mentioned before
                            that they are the ones who
                            <b>transform pixels into actions</b>, so it might
                            seem like they're only involved once you finish the
                            design and hand over the document. But the magic
                            really happens when we can have

                            Showing my notes to developers has
                            <b>taken my components to the next level</b>. We
                            share ideas on how to handle different scenarios
                            using the same element and even make adjustments on
                            the fly, because some aspect of the design might
                            look different depending on which platform it's on.

                            Talk to other designers, ask them if there’s
                            anything else that can be added. I like to
                            <b>add a few complete examples</b> to my most
                            versatile components. That way, when someone is
                            creating a screen, they can get some ideas on how to
                            use them <b>outside of the box</b>
                            — without adding another component to the to-do list
                            of our implementation team.

                            The considerations for character limits wouldn’t
                            have happened if I didn’t work with localization.

                            is great practice. They don’t need to know the ins
                            and outs of every decision, but a
                            <b>quick intro</b> and a
                            <b>link they can use for reference</b> will go a
                            long way.

                            So, how are you feeling?

                            everything is <b>nice and tidy</b>.
                            <br />
                            If not, it's okay too — maybe you've come out of
                            this with some <b>helpful insights</b> for your own
                            documentation.

                            If I can leave you with one parting thought, it's
                            this: <br />
                            <b
                                >Your design system is about making everyone

                        <p>
                            It might not be fun and glamorous spending hours
                            considering uses and edge cases, or putting in extra
                            time to consider character limits — but
                            <b>if you put the love in, you will get it back</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I know it's hard to keep everyone happy, but a
                            <b>good system</b> can contribute to that in a very
                            positive way. It's the
                            <b>pillar of your product</b> — treat it with
                            respect.

                        <p>
                            Even if your design system is just for yourself as
                            the sole designer, it's at the very least
                            <b>good practice</b>. And with some luck, it can be
                            the <b>foundation for an entire app ecosystem</b>.
