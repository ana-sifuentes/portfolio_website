                            <b><i>Words have failed me.</i></b
                            ><br />But I've learned to use other tools.
                        </p>

                            Humans love <b>symbols</b>. We love
                            <b>communicating</b> <b>without</b> <b>words</b>.
                            You can see it everywhere, from art to branding—a
                            story has been carefully crafted to transcend spoken
                            language. When words fail to express complex
                            feelings, <b>art</b> is there to <b>fill</b> in the
                            <b>gaps</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Painting</b> is a very <b>personal</b> medium for
                            me. As someone who loves to plan, the white canvas
                            provides an <b>empty</b> <b>universe</b> for me to
                            fill with my own world. I get to tell a story using
                            <b>colors</b>, <b>shapes</b>, <b>patterns</b>, and
                            <b>symbols</b>. I can craft this narrative as I see
                            fit; it's up to me if it’s happy or sad, easy to
                            understand, or too complex even for myself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recently, I finished some very <b>challenging</b>
                            <b>paintings</b>—not just because of the
                            <b>size</b> and <b>details</b>, but because of the
                            time they took to <b>finish</b>. I could only paint
                            during very special moments. I needed a lot of
                            <b>energy</b> before even thinking of picking up my
                            brushes.

                        <p>
                            The paintings are a set of <b>murals</b> on the
                            walls of my <b>bedroom</b>.<br />Let me give you a
                            <b>tour</b> of one of them.

                        <h3>Step 1: Idea</h3>
                        <p>
                            I always want to make the <b>spaces</b> I
                            <b>inhabit</b> <b>beautiful</b>. This is one of my
                            <b>core</b> design <b>values</b> and the seed for
                            this project. I love my <b>flat</b>—it’s very sunny
                            and peaceful—but when I moved in, it felt a bit
                            <b>cold</b>. Maybe it was all the white walls and
                            gray furniture, which fit a lovely modern aesthetic
                            but felt cold to my <b>Mexican</b>
                            <b>sensibilities</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Have I mentioned I’m Mexican? Oh, I very much am and
                            will take any chance to remind you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I wanted my space to reflect this, which is why
                            before moving to Europe, I made a pit stop at a
                            market in <b>Mexico</b> <b>City</b> to buy all sorts
                            of <b>handwoven</b> <b>textiles</b>.
                            <i
                                >Pro tip: They’re easy to transport and can make
                                any place feel special.</i
                            >
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Back to my modern flat. I base my <b>decorating</b>
                            <b>decisions</b> on a simple rule: if I look at a
                            room from <b>any</b><i> </i><b>point</b>, I want to
                            have a <b>nice</b> <b>view</b>. The bedroom,
                            although comfortable, needed some help. The plain
                            <b>white</b> <b>walls</b> made me feel like I was
                            waking up in the middle of the <b>fog</b>. So I
                            decided to <b>paint</b> something to bring in some
                            <b>color</b>.
                        </p>

                    <div class="grid-item col-2-2">

                        <h3>Step 2: brief</h3>
                        <p>
                            Okay, up to here, we have some concepts and
                            keywords: <b>warmth, color, Mexico, bedroom, </b>a<b
                            > </b>place<b> </b>where<b> </b>I
                            <b>wake up, </b>a<b> </b>place<b> </b>where<b
                            > </b>I<b> sleep, cycles, beauty.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These ideas helped me narrow down a theme for the
                            room. I’m from the very arid north, so I wanted
                            something that reminded me of it but wasn’t
                            necessarily from my city. Recently, I learned about
                            the <b>Seri people</b>, also known as the
                            <b>Comcáac</b>, an indigenous group native to
                            <b>Sonora, Mexico</b>, near the <b>Baja</b>
                            <b>California</b> region.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I found their worldview fascinating. They have
                            beautiful traditions, like <b>painting</b>
                            <b>flowers</b> on <b>women’s</b> <b>faces</b> and
                            celebrating the <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> in the middle
                            of our year. I’ve always had great
                            <b>appreciation</b> for the <b>indigenous</b>
                            <b>groups</b> of my country, and it’s disappointing
                            that we don’t learn more about them in school or
                            popular media.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, I did some research: on their customs,
                            traditional outfits, and the stories they tell. From
                            their myths, I found imagery and concepts I loved:
                            the<b> stars, </b>the<b> sun </b>and<b> moon, </b
                            >the<b> ocean </b>by<b> </b>the<b> desert, </b
                            >the<b> unforgiving climate </b>of<b> </b>the<b
                            > </b>region<b> </b>that is<b> home </b>to<b>
                                resilient flora </b
                            >and<b> fauna.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Slowly, these pieces started to come together: I<b
                            > </b>would<b> paint </b>the<b> desert </b>to<b>
                                represent cycles. </b
                            >What cycle would I find myself repeating here?
                            <b>Sleeping. </b>I wanted the paintings to hold
                            <b>meaning</b> both at <b>sunrise</b> and
                            <b>sunset</b>, so I focused on depicting the
                            movement of the <b>stars</b> and <b>planets</b>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Step 3: Sketching</h3>

                        <p>
                            A quick <b>confession</b>—I actually started with a
                            different mural before the one I’m describing here.
                            There’s another painting that created the “rules”
                            for all three. It’s a painting of a <b>giant</b>
                            <b>woman</b>, her <b>hair</b> ablaze as she
                            <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> the <b>flowers</b>. She is
                            the <b>sun</b>. It’s called
                            <b><i>Amanecer</i></b> (Sunrise), and the woman is
                            loosely based on one of my <b>aunts</b>. She
                            represents several <b>female</b> <b>figures</b> in
                            my family. I’m not going into that particular mural
                            just yet. I will in the future. But I need a bit
                            more time before I can get that personal. Forgive
                            me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Amanecer</i> was where I made all the
                            <b>emotional</b> and <b>artistic</b>
                            <b>decisions</b>: the <b>color</b> <b>palette</b>,
                            the way I would represent the <b>sky</b> as a
                            <b>gradient</b> so you couldn’t tell which way the
                            stars were moving, the <b>research</b> for the
                            <b>flora</b> of the region. By the time I started
                            working on <b><i>Sol y Luna</i></b> (Sun and Moon)
                            and <b><i>Estrella</i></b> (Star), the next murals,
                            I already had a sandbox to play in.

                        <p>
                            I knew exactly where in the room I would paint the
                            mural and the size of my frame. It would be the
                            <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> before turning off the
                            light and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> when I
                            reached for my phone to turn off the alarm. It had
                            to be <b>important</b>. I knew I needed extra
                            <b>guidance</b>, so I turned to <b>tarot</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tarot cards are full of meaning and symbols. I love
                            them, and luckily, I was working on a canvas with
                            <b>similar</b> <b>proportions</b>. I studied
                            <i>The Moon</i>, <i>The Star</i>, and
                            <i>The Sun</i> cards and decided the story of my
                            mural. A <b>woman</b> dressed in <b>traditional</b>
                            <b>Seri</b> <b>clothing</b> would switch the
                            <b>sun</b> and <b>moon</b>. Was she doing this in
                            the <b>summer</b> as part of the <b>New</b>
                            <b>Year</b>? Was it an <b>everyday</b>
                            <b>chore</b> she performed twice a day? I didn’t
                            have to decide. It could be both. That was what
                            mattered.
                        </p>

                            I prefer to <b>sketch</b> <b>digitally</b>, even if
                            the final product won’t be. My iPad lets me sketch
                            anywhere—from the couch to a coffee shop, depending
                            on my level of laziness. Most importantly, I can
                            <b>refine</b> every line <b>over</b> <b>and</b>
                            <b>over</b> until I’m content. Very
                            <b>convenient</b> for a <b>perfectionist</b> like
                            me.

                        <p>
                            I had my final sketch ready, my walls clean—it was
                            time to grab the <b>brushes</b>. I asked the
                            property owner for <b>permission</b> and got a yes.
                            So, I headed to the <b>local</b> <b>art</b>
                            <b>shop</b> and bought a few 500ml tubs of
                            <b>acrylic</b> <b>paint</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve worked with many <b>different</b>
                            <b>mediums </b>and<b> materials</b>. Oils,
                            watercolors, pastels, markers, ink, pencils, and
                            various combinations of them. But by far, the
                            <b>kindest</b> to me has been <b>acrylics</b>.
                            They’re inexpensive compared to <b>oils</b> yet can
                            achieve similar effects. They’re more versatile than
                            <b>watercolors</b> and more forgiving when you make
                            mistakes. They last a long time, and unlike
                            <b>pastels</b>, you can actually touch the finished
                            product without smudging it. They’re also easier to
                            mix than color <b>markers</b> or <b>pencils</b>, so
                            with just a few base colors, you can achieve the
                            exact tones you want.

                        <p>
                            Happy with my almost five liters of paint and some
                            old brushes I had brought with me from Mexico, I was
                            ready to get started. I <b>outlined</b> my
                            <b>working</b> <b>space</b> with washi
                            <b>tape</b> and sketched the design onto the wall
                            with a pencil. One decimated eraser later, my
                            <b>lines</b> were <b>clean</b> enough for the
                            <b>background</b> layers of <b>paint</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Up to this point, the design and <b>sketching</b>
                            <b>process</b> for the three murals had been
                            relatively <b>fast</b>. I used my free time on
                            weekends, and in a matter of weeks, I had everything
                            ready. The actual <b>painting</b> <b>process</b>,
                            however, was <b>something</b> <b>else</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I struggled at first to mix the <b>right</b>
                            <b>colors</b>, I was out of practice, but after a
                            few tries, I got close enough to my <b>digital</b>
                            <b>palette</b>. Technically, the designs weren’t too
                            difficult. I was working with <b>solid</b>
                            <b>colors</b>, so I just had to keep my
                            <b>lines</b> <b>clean</b>. I used washi tape again
                            to help with precision and bought special paint
                            markers for the tiny details, like the cactus
                            spikes, to ensure <b>consistent</b>
                            <b>linework</b> throughout.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All in all, it wasn’t that many hours of actual
                            painting. Sure, I had to <b>climb</b> onto
                            <b>chairs</b> to reach certain parts, <b>move</b>
                            <b>furniture</b>, and work in some <b>awkward</b>
                            <b>corners</b>, but it was doable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> wasn’t the
                            <b>painting</b> <b>itself</b>. It was
                            <b>having</b> the <b>energy</b> to do it. <br />I’ll
                            explain more in the next section.

                        <p>Why is <b>painting</b> so <b>hard</b> for me?</p>
                        <p>
                            For the times when I feel so <b>happy</b> I can’t
                            stop smiling or the times when I have been
                            <b>overwhelmed</b> beyond my limits, I turn to
                            painting. This <b>medium</b> is deeply
                            <b>emotional</b> and <b>personal</b> for me. It’s a
                            hard <b>mental</b> <b>state </b>to access—it's a
                            place of extremes. <br />I would even go as far as
                            calling it my <b>Avatar</b> <b>state</b>. If you’ve
                            watched <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. If not,
                            it's a powerful condition where the Avatar can
                            access the skills and knowledge of all their past
                            lives, making them incredibly strong.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I remember a conversation in art school when a
                            teacher asked us: what’s the difference between an
                            <b>artist</b> and a <b>professional</b>? According
                            to him, an artist follows their <b>mood</b>, they
                            can only create when their <b>heart</b> is
                            <b>full</b>. A professional doesn’t have that
                            <b>luxury</b>. The <b>creative</b>
                            <b>professional</b> <b>must</b> produce
                            <b>work</b> regardless of whether their cup is full
                            or empty. We have to eat. There’s no rich patron
                            keeping us fed and comfortable in their court.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Except, in this situation, I <b><i>could</i></b>
                            <b>afford</b> the luxury of taking my <b>time</b>. I
                            don’t paint for a living. The only price to pay was
                            a half-finished painting on the wall. I was my own
                            rich patron.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The year I started the murals, I had just
                            <b>moved</b> to Germany and was dealing with so many
                            new things. I had <b>no extra energy</b> to spare.
                            The next year, <b>personal</b>
                            <b>events</b> completely shifted my <b>life</b>
                            <b>plan</b>, pulling my focus elsewhere. Even in
                            these dire conditions, I would find the <b>odd</b>
                            <b>hour</b> to <b>paint</b>. But by the end of last
                            year, things started to stabilize, and I found a
                            <b>pocket</b> of <b>peace</b> to paint. I made the
                            most of it, squeezing in enough sessions to finish
                            the murals.<br /><br />Like all <b>symbols</b>, my
                            <b>murals</b> carry a lot of meaning. A story, a
                            feeling, a <b>piece</b> of <b>me</b>
                            <b>woven</b> into the <b>walls</b>. A moment I was
                            <b>happy</b> enough to paint. A moment I was so
                            <b>sad</b> I needed to paint. <br /><br />I can’t
                            imagine the room without them.
