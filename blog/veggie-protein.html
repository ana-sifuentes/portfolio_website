                            Did I tell you I used to be a
                            <b>vegetarian</b>? In a past life –

                            – I watched a lot of 90s cartoons that told me to
                            <b>save the planet</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My options on what to do were a bit limited, you
                            know, still being a teenager in Mexico, but from my
                            research online I found that a
                            <b>vegetarian diet</b> was a way to contribute as an
                            individual.

                            Great, I thought, I can do this, I just need to
                            change <b>everything I eat</b>.

                        <p>
                            I lived in <b>Monterrey</b>, a city famous for
                            needing no excuse to fire up the grill. My first
                            step was convincing my family to let me be a
                            vegetarian, so I did one of the things I know how to
                            do best: make a <b>PowerPoint</b>. Sorry mom and
                            dad, you invested in a good school and I pay you
                            back by sitting you down for 30 mins to hear about
                            vegetarianism.

                            It was a bit of an uphill battle, but after some
                            <b>negotiations</b> and <b>compromises</b>, I had
                            that precious <b>"OK"</b>. Under one condition: I
                            had to cook all my meals... how long do you think
                            this lasted?

                            This week we are back talking about <b>food</b>. I'm
                            sharing some of my <b>hard-earned knowledge</b> from
                            my vegetarian times.

                            One of the main concerns for a
                            <b>vegetarian diet</b> is getting enough
                            <b>protein</b>. This was also my mom's biggest fear,
                            so another condition was that a
                            <b>nutritionist</b> had to design my meal plan.
                            <b>Eggs</b>, <b>tofu</b>,
                            <b>textured soy protein</b>, <b>lentils</b>,
                            <b>dairy</b> – I needed to make sure to include one
                            of them in every meal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I wasn’t a very good <b>cook</b> back then. I had to
                            learn that you really need to <b>season tofu</b> to
                            make it taste like something, and just boiling
                            vegetables will get boring very fast.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If I could give some advice to my younger self, it
                            would be to turn to the
                            <b>flavors we had at home</b>. Nowadays
                            <b>chilaquiles</b> have become a staple breakfast.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A bed of crunchy <b>tortilla chips (totopos)</b> is
                            covered with <b>salsa</b>, <b>cream</b>, and
                            <b>eggs</b> – sometimes even <b>chicken</b>. For my
                            <b>low-calorie</b>,
                            <b>high-veggie protein</b> version, I replace the
                            totopos with <b>baked corn waffles</b>, use
                            <b>low-fat cream cheese</b>, and something called
                            "<b>like chicken</b>." Oh, and I make my own very
                            <b>spicy salsa</b> to dress everything – it's a
                            great way to start the day.

                            Did I cheat during my <b>vegetarian</b> times? Not
                            to my knowledge back then. There were things that I
                            later found out actually had a bit of
                            <b>animal products</b>. Some <b>cheeses</b> use
                            animal parts during their production,
                            <a
                                href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/why-isnt-parmesan-vegetarian/"
                            >
                                here is more info </a
                            >, which I only found out a few years ago.

                        <p>
                            I'm not a super strict vegetarian nowadays. If
                            anything, I would call myself a <b>flexitarian</b> –
                            mostly eating vegetarian except when I travel or go
                            out to restaurants. So eating a bit of
                            <b>parmesan</b> is not really a problem to me. And
                            if you read my article on comparing proteins (<a
                                href="/blog/protein-battle"
                                >read Protein Battle here</a
                            >), you’ll know that parmesan actually packs in a
                            good amount of <b>protein per gram</b>. Adding it as
                            a <b>topping</b> will boost your numbers instantly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My second meal suggestion is a
                            <b>veggie bolognese</b> – put "veggie" in quotations
                            if you add the parmesan. As a
                            <b>meat substitute</b>, I use a
                            <b>textured pea protein</b>. This magical food has
                            <b>74g of protein</b> for every 100g. It’s insane. I
                            didn’t have fake meats like this one before. Good
                            job, <b>German engineering</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this recipe, I make my own <b>sauce</b> mixing
                            <b>canned tomatoes</b> with <b>garlic</b>,
                            <b>carrots</b>, <b>onion</b>, and lots of
                            <b>spices</b>. I add the hydrated
                            <b>pea protein</b> afterwards and let it all
                            <b>simmer</b> for a while before placing it on top
                            of some <b>al dente pasta</b>. Finish everything –
                            or not – with your favorite <b>cheese</b> and some
                            <b>fresh basil</b>.

                            Why did I choose <b>100g of protein</b> as a daily
                            goal? I actually <b>calculated</b> that number! It's
                            the amount of protein I need given my <b>age</b>,
                            <b>gender</b>, <b>weight</b>, and

                            is around 40-something grams, but since I want to
                            keep my muscles nice and healthy, I go for the
                            middle-upper range. As long as I hit <b>100g</b>,

                            because I try to be in a <b>calorie deficit</b> so I

                            for details. I do eat more than just these meals – I
                            have a few <b>snacks</b> throughout the afternoon:

                            These help me fuel my workouts and give me the extra

                            be dramatic, but <b>skyr</b> saves the day. Super
                            low fat, low calorie, and high in protein. Is it hot
                            and I want something that vaguely feels like frozen
                            yogurt? Am I too lazy to cook anything? Skyr is
                            there.

                        <p>
                            I finish the day with some <b>vanilla skyr</b>,
                            <b>berries</b>, and <b>almonds</b>. It's
                            <b>sweet</b>, <b>refreshing</b>, and perfect for
                            summer. Add some <b>fake sugar</b> if you want that
                            extra sweetness.

                            You might be wondering why this post is reviving my
                            ancient knowledge... but have you seen the
                            <b>price of chicken</b>? One of the advantages I
                            listed to my parents all those years ago was that it
                            would be <b>cheaper</b> – you spend way less on
                            <b>legumes</b> and <b>vegetables</b> than on
                            <b>beef</b> and <b>pork</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By the way, did you guess? <br />
                            It was <b>10 years</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I was a strict <b>vegetarian</b> for 10 years, some
                            periods of that being <b>vegan</b>. I think what
                            also fueled my conviction was that my mom said it
                            would just be a phase, that I would give it up soon
                            enough. She forgot I’m as <b>stubborn</b> as her.
                            Thank you, mom, for making me so <b>determined</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I had to stop when I was
                            <b>traveling a lot for work</b> and couldn’t have a
                            reliable diet.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I wasn’t alone though, in my adventure of being
                            vegetarian. It's
                            <b>easier to cook for 2 people</b> than for
                            yourself. My younger brother joined me – he would
                            share meals with me Monday through Friday, but eat
                            whatever he wanted on weekends. That helped a lot
                            and it made <b>cooking more fun</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I hope you can also share your <b>meals</b> with
                            someone you <b>love</b>.
                        </p>
