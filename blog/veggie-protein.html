                            I'm a bit late writing this week. Recently, life has
                            been <b>overwhelming</b> for everyone, and for me
                            personally I've been
                            <b>working late into the night</b> for several days.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So let's relax for a bit, let's find something
                            <b>fun</b> to distract ourselves. After all, we need
                            a bit of <b>silliness</b> to survive the endless
                            waves of <b>emails</b>, <b>Slack messages</b>,
                            <b>terrible news</b>, etc. Pick your modern poison.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What do you do to relax and center yourself?<br />
                            Different doctrines will tell you to turn to
                            <b>mindfulness</b> and <b>disconnect</b>. Which is a
                            good option, and I've tried to do it from time to
                            time. But sometimes I don't want to transcend the
                            reincarnation cycle, I just want to <b>laugh</b> for
                            a bit <b>before replying</b> to another dreadful
                            WhatsApp message.

                            <b>Doomscrolling</b> on Instagram until the third
                            app in a row finally makes me throw my phone across
                            the room is not ideal, so I try to look for
                            something <b>silly</b> to focus on. These last few
                            days, it has been <b>"fun data observations"</b> —
                            let me show you some examples.

                        <p>
                            I was waiting for the train to get to the airport
                            the other day. After rushing to get to the station,
                            the display showed a <b>delay</b>. Ah, the joys of
                            living in <b>Germany</b>, I thought. The biggest
                            surprise when I moved here was that the trains
                            <b>"die"</b> very frequently. Yeah, they just go
                            <b>"poof"</b>, no more train. Time to wait, get
                            comfy on the platform, you live there now. Germans
                            everywhere confirm this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But I digress. It was a <b>chilly morning</b> so I
                            had a cardigan on, and I had nothing to do, so I
                            started picking at the little balls on it. I didn’t
                            know they were called <b>'pills'</b>. I ended up
                            collecting them in my hand (see above) until the
                            train arrived.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I then thought to make a silly comparison: how much
                            time would it take me to get through
                            <b>airport security</b> vs waiting for the
                            <b>S-Bahn</b>? Well, you can see below. I found it
                            was a better use of my time to focus on finding
                            something silly to text my
                            <b>favorite engineer</b> than getting annoyed at
                            <b>Deutsche Bahn</b>.

                            Another example? I had to wait in line at a
                            <b>bakery</b>. Normally I don't like to wait in line
                            — in fact, I <b>hate it</b>. But my friend told me
                            this was the <b>best bakery in Copenhagen</b>, we
                            had to go. The line was <b>40 minutes</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My silly thought was to wonder if there a
                            <b>correlation</b> between <b>time</b> spent waiting
                            in line and <b>pastry flavor</b>? <br />
                            Not usually in my experience, but here we had an
                            <b>outlier</b>. This was <b>worth the wait</b>...
                            dear lord, I didn’t think humans could make bread
                            even better. This is a free shoutout to
                            <b>Juno the Bakery</b>. They don’t need the promo
                            but they deserve it.

                            One last example, I went for a long walk yesterday
                            and noticed a <b>new path</b> in the park. It didn’t
                            make much sense since there was a
                            <b>bigger path</b> right next to it and it seemed
                            that this was more recent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Who wanted to cut 2 seconds from their walking PB?
                            It wasn’t very useful but it reminded me of this
                            <b>phenomenon</b> where people make their own paths
                            despite having another planned one right next to it.
                            (It's called
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path"
                                >Desired path</a
                            >) This is fairly common in <b>urban landscapes</b>,
                            see if you can spot one next time you go to the
                            train station.

                        <p>
                            Animals do them too, is it our need to find the best
                            solution or just our desire to go fast?

                            I know these examples are silly but I'm fond of the
                            <b>spirit</b> behind them. Focusing on the world
                            around you and trying to see things from a slightly
                            <b>different angle</b> is key to make your
                            day-to-day special. If you don't
                            <b>romanticize</b> your life, who will?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I think this spirit also helps with being
                            <b>creative</b>. A few weeks ago, a dear friend
                            asked me how I come up with stuff for the blogs. I
                            didn’t give her a good answer back then and just
                            shrugged, but I think the ideas come from these
                            <b>silly observations</b>, from wanting to keep
                            myself <b>entertained</b> and make people in my life
                            <b>laugh</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If I can leave you with one last nice thought during
                            these seemingly endless trying times, it's something
                            my mom says:
                            <i
                                >"Vive cada día no como si fuera el último, sino
                                el primero."</i
                            >
                            Live every day not like it’s the last one, but the
                            <b>first</b> one.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, if you look at the same old things with
                            <b>new eyes</b>, what silly observations will you
                            notice?
                        </p>
