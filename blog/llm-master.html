                        <p>
                            <b>LLMs</b>, or <b>large language models</b>, are
                            one of the big <b>AI tools</b> right now.<br />
                            Are they good? Are they bad? Yes and no.<br />
                            Like any tool, it depends on how it's being used.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Will <b>AI</b> replace us? Unfortunately, for some
                            of us, yes. New technological advancements come hand
                            in hand with replacing '<b>repetitive</b>' work. You
                            can find endless examples throughout history. Ever
                            since we got creative and started adding wheels to
                            carts, we decided not to stop and find other ways to
                            reduce work.<br />
                            If we can find a way to be lazy, we will.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What can we do now? Babe, wake up, it's time to use
                            <b>AI</b>. We can only catch up; don't stay too far
                            behind. If you have the chance to test a new
                            technology early on, go for it. Even if this tool
                            doesn't kick off completely, knowledge is never
                            wasted.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I speak from experience because I found myself in
                            this very situation in early 2024. I needed to train
                            an <b>LLM</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Did I know about <b>LLMs</b> back then? No, babe. It
                            was time to learn.<br />
                            Let me tell you about it.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grid-item col-4-4">
                        <img
                            src="../assets/blog/llm-master/sifuentes-llm-master-1.png"

                    </div>

                        <h3>

                            <b>Pokémon</b>?
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            First, a disclaimer. My knowledge is mostly on the
                            <b>content</b>, <b>training</b>, and
                            <b>documentation</b> side. <b>Implementation</b> was
                            done by engineers. So, in this case I'm not a super
                            technical Pokémon trainer, but I was able to win
                            some battles.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>LLMs</b> are <b>artificial intelligence</b> tools
                            that use large amounts of data to understand and
                            generate natural human language. They are good at
                            predicting what comes next, so they can help you
                            improve your writing, bounce ideas, and make
                            calculations. However, they
                            <b>aren't all-powerful</b>. They are
                            <b>limited </b>by the <b>data</b> used to train
                            them. Plus, they inherit any
                            <b>implicit biases</b> that those data pools come
                            with.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We can think of <b>LLMs</b> as having different
                            'parts':
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Corpus</b> = the data they draw from</li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Pre-prompt</b> = how they process this data
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Output</b> = the final outcome they give you
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Also, you want to make sure the output is relevant
                            and valuable, so there is also
                            <b>quality evaluation</b> involved in the process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I theorize they are like <b>Pokémon</b> because they
                            can be powerful, but they <b>depend on you</b> to
                            train them properly, and they can only perform the
                            limited set of moves you let them learn.
                        </p>

                        <p>Now let's see if my analogy works:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Documentation</b> = the moves your Pokémon
                                has and its level
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Pre-prompt</b> = how you train the Pokémon
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Output</b> = the Pokémon using its training
                                and attacks; basically how it fights
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>QA</b> = making sure it's winning battles and
                                getting ribbons
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Is this my best analogy? Pokémon fans say yes.<br />
                            Let's go over my Pokémon training strategy now.

                        <p>
                            Before making any decisions about what types of
                            <b>documents</b> you need to ‘feed’ your <b>LLM</b>,
                            you need to think of the <b>use case</b>. What kinds
                            of battles will your <b>LLM</b> fight? Most likely,
                            your <b>LLM</b> will already have access to a large
                            pool of information collected from the internet.
                            Think of what <b>ChatGPT</b> already knows.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But this pool, however vast, is <b>limited</b>. For
                            my use case, it had very little relevant
                            information. I needed my <b>LLM</b> to answer
                            <b>product-specific</b> questions for the
                            <b>Freeletics</b> app. The untrained model knew what
                            Freeletics was, but had no information on the
                            different tabs or exclusive workouts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What did I do? I started
                            <b>curating information</b> to feed it. I divided
                            the information into two large buckets:
                            <b>internal sources</b> and <b>external sources</b>.
                            I also wanted to influence the <b>tone</b> of how it
                            spoke about fitness, so I curated
                            <b>Freeletics</b> articles that were
                            <b>informative</b> and <b>descriptive</b>. I also
                            researched the most frequent fitness questions
                            people asked online and wrote four
                            <b>pillar articles</b> to guide the
                            <b>LLM’s tone of voice</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The biggest part of the work was adding
                            <b>product specific information </b>. This involved
                            pulling data from the backend and other sources, and
                            translating it into a format the <b>LLM</b> could
                            understand.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At first, I thought that writing in a more casual,
                            human way would work best. But after trial and
                            error, I found the best formula:
                            <b>smaller chunks of information</b> that were
                            <b>clearly labeled</b>. Basically, think
                            <b>bullet points</b> instead of large paragraphs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This became especially useful when I moved on to the
                            next part—training the Pokémon to best use its
                            moves.

                        <h3>3) <b>Pre-prompt</b></h3>
                        <p><i>Or how you use your Pokémon in battle.</i></p>

                        <p>
                            The <b>pre-prompt</b> tells the <b>LLM</b> how to
                            behave. Here, specificity is your friend. You can
                            tell the <b>LLM</b> to pretend to be a positive and
                            encouraging fitness instructor, or a pesky Pokémon
                            rival that’s going to push you to your limits.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is where the <b>labels</b> I had specified in
                            the <b>documentation</b> became crucial.<br />
                            The product manual had very specific internal
                            terms—for example, fitness plans were called
                            <b>“training journeys”</b>. However, new users might
                            not be familiar with that concept and could refer to
                            them with other generic names. I specified in the
                            prompt to identify these general terms and, when
                            responding to the user, to use our internal term so
                            that users would learn how to find this info in the
                            app.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another benefit of breaking down the information was
                            that it made it easier for future implementation in
                            other languages. I wrote all the documentation in
                            <b>English</b> because I wanted to avoid rewriting
                            all the files into their localized target languages.
                            Can you imagine going back and editing information
                            in nine different files, and then sending each of
                            those to translators to confirm the changes made
                            sense? Nope. It was essential that the files stayed
                            in English.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The plan I devised was to specify the
                            <b>internal term</b> alongside its
                            <b>translations</b> in the documentation and only
                            localize the <b>prompt</b>. I broke down the prompt
                            into sections and clearly documented what each part
                            was meant to do. I even accounted for
                            <b>language-specific behaviors</b>. For example,
                            speaking to German users in a formal tone. I tested
                            my process by translating the prompt into Spanish,
                            then sat down with the <b>localization team</b> to
                            discuss what extra nuances they could add to their
                            localized versions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once the <b>pre-prompts</b> were translated, we
                            tested the output with a set of frequently asked,
                            translated questions to measure the success of the
                            answers. The results were very positive!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            How did I measure that exactly? With the help of
                            <b>QA</b>!

                        <p>
                            For this part, I collaborated with my dear friend,
                            <b>Liza</b> (yes, the same glamorous
                            <b>QA engineer</b> featured in a previous blog.
                            <a href="/blog/presentation-style">read it here!</a
                            >).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We worked together to design a <b>rubric</b> to
                            evaluate the LLM's answers. The score was based on
                            the average of metrics such as <b>relevancy</b>,
                            <b>correctness</b>, and <b>personalization</b>. We
                            also added a quick <b>feedback survey</b> button so
                            users could indicate whether the answer was helpful
                            or not.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We were very mindful of <b>data privacy</b> and
                            complying with <b>GDPR</b> laws, so we ensured all
                            data was handled with care and fully anonymized
                            before pulling random samples to evaluate.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This <b>QA process</b> helped me identify weak areas
                            in the <b>documentation</b> and make iterative
                            changes to improve. Analyzing trends and frequent
                            questions also helped prioritize which topics to
                            start with, making the process more streamlined and
                            effective. I took notes on which battles my Pokémon
                            wasn’t doing so great in and went back to level up.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also got to share the work with an <b>intern</b> I
                            mentored throughout the project, helping them grow
                            their skills in <b>documentation</b>,
                            <b>data analysis</b>, and
                            <b>presenting insights</b>. I had to be very clear
                            in documenting my processes and doing frequent
                            check-ins to ensure we were working in sync and
                            getting the best results from our data.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the end, the project was very successful:
                            <b>90%</b> of respondents rated the answers as
                            <b>useful</b>, and we increased
                            <b>activation rates</b> by approximately
                            <b>9%</b> during A/B testing.

                            I hope this article demystifies how <b>LLMs</b> work
                            and how you can train one. It’s a lot of information
                            to consider, but it can be done with a good
                            <b>strategy</b>. In fact, if you want to read the
                            project’s results, you can check out the
                            <a href="work/llm-training">case study</a> here.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I’ll be honest, this is a streamlined version of how
                            the project was laid out. There are lots of extra
                            considerations you have to make when dealing with
                            <b>new technologies</b>. Saying that training an
                            <b>LLM</b> can be done by one person is a bit of an
                            overstatement. It takes a <b>team</b> to properly
                            implement one, plus ongoing <b>refinement</b> to
                            make sure you’re delivering the best value possible
                            to users.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Things change very quickly on the front end of
                            <b>technology</b>. Even in the last few months,
                            we’ve seen how <b>search behavior</b> on Google has
                            shifted. You don’t necessarily click links anymore
                            because <b>AI</b> now provides you with a quick
                            summary. This is one of the reasons I recommend that
                            products invest in creating their own <b>LLM</b>.
                            Consumers are now used to searching using
                            <b>natural language</b> rather than just key search
                            terms.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the end, did I become a <b>Pokémon Master</b>?
                            No.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But <b>Ash Ketchum</b> didn’t win the Pokémon League
                            on his first try either. If Pokémon taught me
                            anything about training <b>LLMs</b>, it’s that you
                            have to be patient, train your Pokémon with care,
                            and make the best choices possible to win the
                            battle.
