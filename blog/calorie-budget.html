                        <h3>STEP 1: base spending</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first thing to do is figure out how many
                            <b>calories</b> you <b>burn</b> just by
                            <b>existing</b>. Humans spend energy on basic
                            functions like breathing, circulation, and nutrient
                            processing. This is called your
                            <b>basal metabolic rate</b>, or <b>BMR</b>. It's
                            basically the number of calories your body needs to
                            do these primary functions and stay at the same
                            weight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since we’re thinking of calories as how much we can
                            eat, we can treat this like our <b>base income</b> -
                            our initial budget.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How do you calculate yours?<br />Factors like
                            <b>activity level</b> (sedentary, light, moderate,
                            or high), <b>age</b>, <b>height</b>, <b>weight</b>,
                            and <b>sex assigned at birth</b> influence your
                            <b>BMR</b>. If you’re bigger or have more muscle
                            mass, you’ll need more calories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can try calculating it yourself with a formula,
                            but there are tools online that will give you a
                            general estimate. I’ve used
                            <a
                                href="https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html"
                                >this calculator</a
                            >
                            in the past.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Not surprisingly, I <b>don’t</b> <b>need</b> a
                            <b>lot</b> of <b>calories</b>. My BMR is around
                            <b>1300 calories</b>, and if I don’t move at all in
                            a day - beyond getting food and moving from bed to
                            couch and back again - I won’t make it past
                            <b>1500 calories</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you think about it in budget terms, my
                            <b>income</b> is pretty <b>meager</b>.<br />So I
                            need <b>alternative sources </b>of<b> income</b
                            >.<br />
                            How? By <b>moving</b> <b>more</b> and thus adding
                            <b>active</b> <b>calories</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here’s where I enlisted the help of a
                            <b>fitness tracker</b>. There are quite a few models
                            available on the market and you can find pretty
                            affordable ones. If you’re just walking or doing
                            simple stuff, Apple Health or Google Fit are already
                            on your phone and can be a good fallback.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the tracker, every movement counts. I can
                            measure all my activities and see how much I “spent”
                            by being active. I even did a blog comparing
                            workouts (<a href="blog/workout-vs-workout.html"
                                >find it here</a
                            >) to find the one that <b>burned</b> the
                            <b>most</b> <b>calories</b>. Turns out,
                            <b>cardio </b>is<b> </b>your<b> best friend</b>. I’m
                            very partial to <b>dancing</b> and <b>walking</b> -
                            they always help me reach my calorie goals for the
                            day.

                        <h3>STEP 2: TRACK SPENDING</h3>
                        <p>
                            This one’s pretty <b>straightforward</b>: figure out
                            <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>calories</b> you’re
                            eating.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I use the <b>app</b> connected to my <b>fitness</b>
                            <b>tracker</b> to <b>log</b> <b>what</b> I’m
                            <b>eating</b>. It can be a bit annoying at first,
                            but once you’re in the habit, it becomes second
                            nature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This way I can see if I’m above, below, or at my
                            <b>maintenance level</b>, how much budget I have
                            left for the day, and according to that,
                            <b>plan</b> my <b>next</b> <b>meal</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A few times a week, I <b>aim</b> to be at least a
                            few <b>hundred</b> <b>calories</b> <b>under</b>.
                            Why? I like going out to <b>restaurants</b> and
                            <b>relaxing</b> on the <b>weekend</b>. It’s hard to
                            find the exact number of calories in a dish cooked
                            by someone else, so it’s better to
                            <b>overestimate</b> to keep yourself on track.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This also motivates me to
                            <b>increase my activity level</b>. If it’s a
                            friend’s birthday or we’re celebrating something big
                            tonight, I’m going to try to <b>walk</b>
                            <b>everywhere</b> all day to make sure I can
                            <b>leave</b> the <b>counting</b> for <b>another</b>
                            <b>night</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On days where I’m aiming to stay
                            <b>below</b> maintenance, I choose very healthy
                            meals. <br />I <b>avoid</b> cooking with
                            <b>oils</b> and try to limit my <b>carb</b> intake
                            so my calories don’t go up too fast. I’ll have
                            <b>salads</b> and <b>curries</b> a few times per
                            week and snack frequently on <b>fruits </b>and<b>
                                veggies</b
                            >.<br /><br />The trick is to stay at a balance:
                            <b>most</b> <b>meals</b> eating <b>healthy</b>, and
                            then enjoying <b>treats</b> when they matter.

                            can <b>start</b> <b>playing</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let me give you an example: earlier this week I had
                            a very <b>stressful</b> <b>day</b> and wanted to
                            enjoy a <b>pizza</b> with a little <b>Aperol</b>.
                            <br /><br />I started with a<b>
                                late, light breakfast</b
                            >
                            and <b>walked</b> to the restaurant, where I enjoyed
                            my lovely lunch. Then I <b>walked</b> back home -
                            with a <b>gelato</b> in hand. For dinner, I already
                            knew it had to be a salad. Even so, I was still
                            <b>above</b> my calorie limit. So it was time for a
                            <b>night walk</b>. After a pleasant nighttime stroll
                            and a lovely chat, I was back in <b>budget</b> with
                            <b>40 calories </b>to<b> spare</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a strategy I’ve been using:
                            <b>gentle cardio</b>. Nothing too intense, since I
                            already lift weights at the gym. Just
                            <b>moving more</b> - and enjoying it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This works <b>great for holidays</b>. You’re already
                            ready to indulge and rest but you also have a lot of
                            free time and can move around more. A true holiday
                            for me is just <b>walking everywhere</b> in a
                            <b>new</b> <b>city</b> with a <b>pastry</b> in hand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you need <b>something</b> <b>else</b> to bring
                            balance - because you can’t walk outside, maybe it’s
                            cold or raining, or maybe you just don’t feel like
                            going out - you can always put on YouTube and do
                            <b>Just Dance videos</b> or a
                            <b>nighttime fitness routine</b> and burn the
                            calories you need to stay at maintenance level.<br /><br />No
                            need to overdo it. All<b> movement </b>is<b> good</b
                            >.

                            If I want you to leave with one<b> takeaway</b> from
                            this post, it’s this:
                            <b>moving more does wonders. </b>You don’t need to
                            restrict yourself, you just need to <b>find</b>
                            <b>balance</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Data is going to be your best friend. You have to
                            <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you
                            <b>need</b> and how much you’re <b>spending</b>.
                            Yes, it can be annoying, but for me, it’s
                            <b>more annoying not</b> to <b>enjoy </b>my<b>
                                pistachio croissant</b
                            >. I’m a fiend for a good flat white, and if my
                            <b>meager</b> <b>BMR</b> isn’t going to help, I’ll
                            <b>figure</b> it <b>out</b> <b>myself</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your work doesn’t let you move too much or enjoy
                            flexible hours, try <b>sneaking </b>in<b>
                                more movement</b
                            >
                            throughout the day. See if you can switch your
                            commute. Even small things start adding up:
                            <b>taking</b> the <b>stairs</b>, going for a
                            <b>walk</b> during <b>lunch</b>, or convincing
                            someone to have a <b>walking</b> <b>meeting</b>.

                            <b>Big disclaimer</b>: I’m <b>not</b> a

                            <b>gain</b> <b>weight</b> in a <b>healthy</b> way, I
                            recommend <b>talking</b> to your <b>doctor</b> to
                            find the <b>best</b> <b>diet</b> for your
                            <b>needs</b>. Not everyone is made the same, and we
                            all have different needs. For example, the
                            <b>protein</b> <b>intake</b> I need might be very
                            <b>different</b> from yours, even if we
                            <b>train</b> <b>similarly</b>.

                            >to <b>data </b>and try to say <b>yes</b> to
