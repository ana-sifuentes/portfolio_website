                        <p>
                            I try to stay <b>active every day</b> – and while
                            it’s good for my health, I’m not gonna lie, it’s
                            hard. You’ll find lots of think pieces and apps
                            pushing you to stay <b>motivated</b> and wake up
                            early to beat everyone else. <br />
                            <br />
                            Something like:
                            <i>your hard-earned sweat is what sets you apart</i>
                            kind of message. You can see the posts: dark high
                            contrast photography, bold big text sort of style.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For me, sticking to a <b>routine</b> and giving my
                            all on the mat also requires extra motivation, even
                            if I would consider myself a naturally
                            <b>sporty inclined</b> person. But honestly, what I
                            think could make a real difference? Not joining a
                            gym or taking group classes – I’m not in the
                            business of paying extra money – but
                            <b>finding the right outfit</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Nothing beats <b>feeling cute</b> when I have
                            another dumbbell killer set to do.
                        </p>

                            However, my <b>workout closet</b> needs a revamp, so
                            today we are going to use this as a
                            <b>case study</b> to develop a
                            <b>capsule wardrobe</b>. Hopefully, you can use the
                            formulas here to create your own.

                        <h3>1) Research Questions</h3>

                        <p>
                            When creating your <b>capsule wardrobe</b> you need
                            to start by asking yourself two key questions:
                            <b>in what context</b> will you use your clothes,
                            and <b>how often</b> do you need to refresh them?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Like in <b>product design</b>, you have to think
                            about the <b>user's needs</b>. Your day-to-day
                            outfits depend on your <b>activities</b>. It’s very
                            different if you have to run errands up and down
                            using public transportation in a big city than if
                            you work in an office and move by car.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If your days are too different, consider what I’m
                            doing: I keep one <b>main wardrobe</b> throughout
                            the year that is flexible enough to accommodate
                            different situations, and now I’m developing a
                            <b>smaller capsule</b> for my <b>workouts</b>.
                            Clothes don’t overlap here, so it makes sense to
                            keep them separate.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can have a super minimal wardrobe if you can do
                            <b>laundry every 3 days</b>, but if your washing
                            cycle is once every two weeks, you will need more
                            clothes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <b>style</b> and <b>amount</b> depends on your
                            needs, so make sure you know them before you start.

                            Let’s dive deeper into the main questions with some
                            extra questions.

                        <p>
                            We already know I need
                            <b>cute workout outfits</b> so I can move every day.
                            Even on rest days, I do <b>active recovery</b> or
                            <b>yoga</b>. I also do <b>laundry once per week</b>,
                            so I need outfits for <b>7 days</b>.

                        <h4>2.1) Personal Considerations</h4>

                        <p><b>So, what sports do I like to do?</b></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Strength training</li>
                            <li>Dancing</li>
                            <li>Yoga</li>
                            <li>Hiking</li>
                            <li>Cycling</li>
                            <li>Bouldering</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            I have a good variety here. The first three fall
                            under the <b>indoor at-home workout</b> category,
                            just me and a YouTube video. The others are
                            <b>outdoors</b> or at a <b>special gym</b>, so I
                            might need more equipment to do them. If I’m
                            completely honest, most days I’m doing the first
                            three, and on the weekends I go out for cycling.
                            It’s been a cold and rainy summer, so I haven’t had
                            much chance to venture into the mountains, and my
                            bouldering buddies have been traveling.

                        <p>
                            My routine is based on:
                            <a
                                href="https://www.shape.com/fitness/training-plans/perfectly-balanced-week-workouts"

                            >.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I want something <b>sustainable</b> that doesn’t
                            feel like a chore and gives me enough
                            <b>variety</b>. My goal is to stay
                            <b>fit and strong</b> doing the things I like.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Strength training</b> → 3 times → Monday,
                                Tuesday, Friday
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Yoga</b> → 1+ time(s) per week → Wednesday +
                                Sunday
                            </li>
                            <li><b>HIIT</b> → 1 time per week → Thursday</li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Light cardio*</b> → 1–2 times per week →
                                Saturday + Sunday
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            I would say the types of outfits depend on how
                            <b>intense</b> the activity is. If we evaluate them
                            on an <b>intensity scale</b>, we’ll see how much
                            <b>support</b> is needed from when I’m jumping
                            around:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            From this I can start drawing
                            <b>concrete numbers</b> of what I need:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>2 low-intensity sets</b>- Can also be used
                                for lounging
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>4 HIIT + strength training sets</b> |
                                <b>high intensity</b>- Can be used for hiking
                                too
                            </li>

                            <li>

                        <p>
                            For cycling, I’m being a bit greedy. I watched too
                            much Tour de France and now I want a

                        <p>
                            This can be easily answered by my <b>Figma file</b>.
                            I kept a section for <b>sport/lounge</b>, so now we
                            can take a look at it.

                        <h3>3) <b>Calculations</b></h3>

                        <p>
                            To be honest, my <b>workout closet</b> was feeling a
                            bit dull, so I did some cleaning before showing you
                            this trimmed-down version. So based on what I still
                            have: <b>what pieces do I need to add?</b> Being a
                            lady, I need some extra support — not just tops and
                            bottoms — so I added <b>2 sports bras</b> to make
                            sure I have one for every day I'm active.
                        </p>

                        <p>If we look at the week, I need:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>1 low-intensity set</b></li>
                            <li><b>1 high-intensity set</b></li>
                            <li><b>1 cycling set</b></li>
                            <li><b>2 sports bras</b></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="note">
                            This is how a whole week of outfits could look like:

                        <p>
                            Now that I made my <b>wishlist</b>, how much do I
                            want to spend? As I said, I’m not in the business of
                            overspending, so my plan is to purchase everything
                            from a <b>second-hand platform</b>. I’ve
                            name-dropped it in the past, and I use it frequently
                            when I need to replace an item in my closet. Hey
                            <b>Vinted</b>, how about a collab or sponsorship?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Back to calculations: I think I can get away with
                            getting all this <b>new gear</b> for under
                            <b>100 euros</b>. Listen, if budget wasn’t a problem
                            and we were going top shelf, we could really sink in
                            a few hundred. Some sport brands will sell you a
                            <b>cycling jersey</b> for <b>70 euros</b>. Sadly, I
                            am not <b>Jonas Vingegaard</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So after a few hours of browsing, here is my
                            wishlist. The ~ symbol represents
                            <b>estimated prices</b>, since the final cost will
                            vary a bit depending on <b>shipping fees</b>. Time
                            to place some orders.

                            So what do you think? Do you like my
                            <b>workout capsule wardrobe</b>? I have to admit I’m
                            looking forward to dancing to
                            <b>"Bad Romance"</b> on Just Dance while wearing
                            that black jumpsuit. Plus, this weekend screams
                            <b>long bike ride</b> to show off my new
                            <b>cycling jersey</b>. Who knows, I could be fit
                            enough to join a <b>Tour de France</b> team. It
                            starts by looking the part.
