                            Hey, it's <b>summer</b> in the northern hemisphere –
                            at least that's what I think.<br />
                            Companies are rolling out their
                            <b>pre-fall campaigns</b> and reminding me of the
                            <b>50% off</b> from the summer collection.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Pre-fall?</b> I haven't even dipped my feet into
                            the river...
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, to cheer us up and focus on the
                            <i>~summer vibes~</i> we are going to do a
                            <b>summer closet audit</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Does that mean <b>organizing</b> and
                            <b>planning</b>? Yes, yes it does. That's how we
                            relax around these parts. That's what you come to
                            this blog for, no? Putting things in their
                            <b>right place</b> so your brain goes "<i
                                >mmm... nice!</i
                            >".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Besides, sorting our <b>summer pieces</b> will
                            create a natural <b>capsule wardrobe</b>, perfect if
                            you are taking a mini holiday trip and getting your
                            very deserved time in the sun.

                        <h3>Methodology</h3>

                        <p>
                            Ok, we already know we’re focusing on <b>summer</b>,
                            but let’s narrow down our scope even further for a
                            thorough review. Let's look at my
                            <b>basic pieces</b>, meaning:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Tops</b></li>
                            <li><b>Bottoms</b></li>
                            <li><b>Shoes</b></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            What about my <b>one-pieces</b> (dresses, rompers),
                            <b>accessories</b>, and <b>layers</b>? We’ll leave
                            those for <b>next week</b>. Why? This week we’re
                            going to try to <b>maximize combinations</b> for
                            packing and <b>efficiency</b> purposes. Even if I
                            also mix and match my dresses, most of the time I
                            wear them as a <b>single item</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We’ll also leave out my <b>workout outfits</b>, note
                            this is different than my <b>sporty</b> tag we’ll
                            see below. These clothes are focused on me going all
                            out during a workout session, not going for a cute,
                            chill bike ride.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, do we need any <b>subcategories</b>? I don’t
                            think so, but we can have some helpful
                            <b>tags</b> like:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Fancy</b></li>
                            <li><b>Sporty</b></li>
                            <li><b>Formal</b></li>
                            <li><b>Casual</b></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            These <b>tags</b> can help me pick outfits depending
                            on the <b>occasion</b>: <b>date night</b> with my
                            favorite engineer,
                            <b>walking coffee catch-up</b> with the girlies, or
                            an <b>important business presentation</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One final thing for our audit: we’ll use my
                            <b>Figma file</b> I mentioned in my
                            <a href="/blog/figma-fashion"
                                >Figma fashion article</a
                            >. That way, we can put together some example
                            outfits without me jumping in and out of clothes.
                        </p>

                        <h3>1) Review</h3>

                        <p>
                            Let’s take a look at what we have. I’ve gathered my
                            <b>tops</b>(9), <b>bottoms</b>(6), and
                            <b>shoes</b>(4) for summer, and I added
                            <b>tags</b> for each of them. Yes, I created
                            everything as <b>components</b> on Figma. Product
                            design tricks that stick forever (<a
                                href="/blog/system-love"
                                >read about design systems here</a
                            >, wink!).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As you can see, some items have more than one
                            <b>tag</b>. I think it would depend on how I
                            <b>mix and match</b> the final classification for
                            the outfit. We'll review this in the next step.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <b>color palette</b> is a subset of my general
                            one. Mostly we have <b>neutrals</b>, which is great
                            for a set of solid <b>basics</b>. Next, we have a
                            few of my <b>complementary colors</b> and a few
                            <b>accents</b>. Good balance so far.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <i>Note:</i> I counted a piece in
                            <b>several colors</b> if it came in more than one,
                            for example those Farm Rio shorts with hearts are in
                            black, cream, and cherry.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If we look at the <b>colors by frequency</b> in the
                            graph below, we can see there’s a lot of great
                            potential for <b>mixing and matching</b>. Let’s
                            start calculating all of our <b>combinations</b>,
                            shall we?

-tops: you will ntoice there are maybe a few new pieces ive replaced - if dont
wear something too often or dont even consider it for my trips, i place it on
hold if months later when i do closet cleanup i dont miss it, then its time for
me to find it a new home.
