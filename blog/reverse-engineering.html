                            I imagined myself wearing this. Walking along the
                            beach on <b>holiday</b>, sunglasses on, big smile.
                            Having a <b>picnic</b> with my friends in the middle
                            of a flower field. Sitting in a <b>coffee shop</b>,
                            wistfully sketching by the window. Strangers paying
                            half a second of attention to me, perhaps even a
                            thought.<br />"Ah, cute sweater."
                        </p>
                        <p>I desired this. I <i>must</i> have this top.</p>
                        <p>What stopped me? The price tag.</p>

                            probably find it <b>sold</b> <b>out</b> on
                            <b>online</b> <b>retailers</b> anywhere between $125
                            to £225. I recall seeing it for around 200 euros. At
                            the time, I couldn't really <b>justify</b> this
                            <b>expense</b> to my accountant.
                            <i>My accountant is me, by the way</i>. It was
                            either this or saying goodbye to one basic need that

                        <h3>Step 1: Technique</h3>
                        <p>
                            I had recently taught myself how to <b>crochet</b>—a
                            few <b>small</b> <b>projects</b>, winter socks, a
                            scarf for my mom, a little devil hat. Tutorials I
                            could follow on YouTube. My actual knitting is very
                            slow (<i
                                >as a German older lady once tried to correct me
                                on the train</i
                            >), but these <b>tutorials</b> were helpful in
                            getting the hang of the different stitch types I
                            would need. After some <b>weeks</b> I
                            knew—<i>theoretically</i>—that I could crochet.<br />
                        </p>
                        <h3>Step 2: OUTLINE</h3>
                        <p>
                            Next, I needed to break down the <b>design</b> into
                            something <b>manageable</b>. I had to trick myself
                            into thinking I could do it, like hiding a pill for
                            a dog in a sausage. I convinced myself to think of
                            the whole piece as just simple <b>geometric</b>
                            <b>shapes</b>—lots of little rectangles and a few
                            curves. I could do that. Right?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I loved the “flowers“ on the design and I assumed
                            these would be the hardest part. So if I could
                            manage those, the other panels would be easy.
                            <i>Medium-hard pill to swallow.</i> After some
                            research, I found out this was called a
                            <b>granny square</b> and found Youtube tutorials to
                            guide me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a saved picture of the top on my phone, I
                            headed to the local yarn store to get my materials.
                            In this case, <b>cotton</b>—which I only knew
                            because of the care instructions on the Farm Rio
                            page.
                        </p>

                    <div class="grid-item col-2-2">
                        <h3>Step 3: Experimentation</h3>
                        <p>
                            I <b>played</b> around with different <b>color</b>
                            <b>combinations</b>. The original design had around
                            four colors per square (plus the cream border), but
                            I found the squares got too big, and I wasn’t a fan
                            of <b>mixing</b> all the colors. Eventually, I
                            landed on using three colors per square, plus the
                            cream border that would connect the entire design.
                            At the end I liked only <b>four</b> specific
                            <b>color</b> <b>patterns</b>, but I had something. I
                            had one of the blocks I needed for the design.<br />
                        </p>
                        <h3>Step 4: Planning</h3>
                        <p>
                            Now, I had to figure out how to put it all
                            <b>together</b>. How many squares should I make? How
                            big should the other panels be? How would I connect
                            everything?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I needed to start making some <b>calculations</b>.
                            Crochet has several <b>notation</b>
                            <b>systems</b> for <b>patterns</b>—written
                            explanations I had seen for large garments or
                            symbols that outline the final shape which is more
                            common for smaller details. Since I was very new to
                            crochet, I was <b>terrible</b> at <b>both</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But what <i>was</i> I good at? Figma. So I
                            <b>measured</b> my granny <b>squares</b> and
                            translated them to their <b>pixel</b>
                            <b>equivalent</b>. If my square was 9×9 cm in the
                            real world, it would be 90×90 pixels on the
                            computer. I took my measurements and sketched out
                            the other parts, planning the garment in two main
                            sections:
                        </p>
                        <ol data-rte-list="default">
                            <li>
                                <p><b>The core</b> – essentially a vest.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>The sleeves</b> – one long rectangle.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            The squares would follow the color combinations I
                            had already tested, while the solid panels would
                            vary in size depending on the fit I wanted. This
                            gave me some flexibility to make the top more
                            <b>tailored</b> to my body. With this <b>plan</b> in
                            place, I noted down how many of each
                            <b>rectangle</b> or <b>square</b> I would need and
                            got to work.

                        <p>
                            Does it sound like I was breezing through the
                            project? Well, no. I could also call this step
                            <b>failing</b><i>. </i>This step took the longest
                            and it was the most frustrating one. But there was
                            no way out except through.<br /><br />With
                            <b>crochet</b>, it can be particularly
                            <b>frustrating</b> that you <b>can’t</b>
                            <b>adjust</b> sizing once you’ve finished knitting a
                            section. This happened several times. I would think
                            the core part was ready, try it on, and realize it
                            was <b>too</b> <b>big</b>. I tested one sleeve once
                            it was fully assembled, only to find it was
                            <b>too</b> <b>small</b>. <br />I found myself
                            unraveling <b>hours</b> of <b>work</b>.
                            <i

                                be,</i
                            >
                            I told myself before breaking down stitches I had so
                            lovingly crafted. <br />If I wanted my dream top, I
                            had to be <b>ruthless</b>. Kill your darlings<i
                                >,</i
                            >
                            they say.

                            After almost two months<i>,</i> I finally saw the
                            light. I found the perfect <b>fit</b> by laying my
                            design on top of a <b>jacket</b> that already fit me
                            like a glove. <i>Just try to match it,</i> I told
                            myself. So I <b>adjusted</b> my <b>pattern</b> based
                            on it, and a week later, the vest was ready. Two
                            weeks after that, the sleeves had taken shape. Some
                            darlings had survived.

                        <p>
                            The end was in sight—I just needed to
                            <b>connect</b> everything. I kept using the
                            <b>jacket</b> as a <b>guide</b>, and since crochet
                            allows you to create curves by reducing stitch
                            count, I was able to shape a really nice neckline.
                            At this point, I was feeling so confident I got a
                            bit fancy and tried a <b>different</b>
                            <b>technique</b> to give the fabric a subtle waffle
                            texture. <br /><br />I also <b>changed</b> the
                            sleeve <b>trims</b> so they would be slightly
                            different from the original design. You can still
                            tell it’s <b>heavily</b> <b>inspired</b>, but it
                            feels <b>more</b> <b>me</b>. By the end, I was such
                            a master at crochet that I even made buttons out of
                            yarn. After three months of work—every evening spent
                            on the couch, watching silly reality shows,
                            <b>knitting</b> the night away like a
                            <b>spider</b>—I had done it. <br /><br /><br />

                        <p>
                            I was so proud of myself I wore the sweater the very
                            next day. I <b>hugged</b> this piece—my
                            <b>precious</b>, my little <b>darling</b>.
                            <br /><br />I can boast now, but if I ever do this
                            again, I’d change a few things. A
                            <b>smarter</b> person would have <b>calculated</b>
                            <b>costs</b> or at least <b>tracked</b> how much
                            <b>yarn</b> was needed. This was a passion project
                            so I spared no expense, I think in the end I spent
                            ~100€ and if I count the hours of work the
                            <b>price</b> is <b>exorbitant</b>. I also should
                            have kept <b>better</b> <b>notes</b>, especially at
                            the end. I was so eager to finish that I skipped
                            counting stitches, which meant having to redo parts
                            of the neckline. But let’s just say these are
                            lessons for <b>future</b> <b>projects</b>. For now,
                            this spider is content—and my hands need a break.
