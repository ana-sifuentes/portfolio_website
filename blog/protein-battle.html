                            <b>Cost</b> can <b>vary</b> a lot depending where
                            you are, you know <b>local</b> <b>advantage</b>. For

                            Im not actually on a tropical island for this).
                            These numbers were obtained from a <b>local</b>
                            <b>supermarket</b> chain that offers online ordering

                            end, and on the opposite side we have our
                            <b>meat</b> <b>options</b>. We have
                            <b>ü•£ Skyr </b>and <b>ü•ñ Seitan </b>as the
                            <b>budget</b>-<b>friendly</b> sources. This last one
                            was calculated based from the seitan starter, so it
                            could depend on the brand and if you buy in bulk,
                            this option could be even lower.
                            <b>üç§ Shrimp </b>stands out as the most expensive
                            protein source. Remember to consider that this is
                            for a city very far away from the sea‚Äîkeep that in
                            mind! üßÄ <b>Parmesan</b> <b>cheese </b>also stands
                            out as being more <b>expensive</b>. A bit of a
                            surprise, but it is quite a delicious cheese in my

                            are other factors that can be considered here, like

                            produce it. These are rounded estimates as a

                            measure is just the beginning, as having a high

                        <p>
                            This is the <b>main</b> <b>event</b>. Who is the
                            <b>nutrition</b> <b>champion</b>?
                        </p>
                        <p>The crowd goes wild!</p>
                        <p>
                            Animal foods are pretty high in protein, with both
                            <b>üçó Chicken breast</b> and
                            <b>ü•© Beef steak</b> hitting above 30 grams.
                            <b>Seafood</b> options are in the 20s, and then
                            <b>ü•ñ Seitan</b> plays in the same tier, packing 25
                            grams. Next come <b>ü•¢ Tofu</b> and <b>ü•£ Skyr</b>,
                            still providing a good amount of protein to round up
                            your plate. <b>üßÄ Parmesan</b> is surprising again
                            with a whopping 35g of protein... makes you wanna
                            take a whole bite of cheese, no?

                            Are you looking for low-cost vegetarian proteins?
                            <b>ü•ñ Seitan</b> is there to pack in protein.
                            <br />Need a bit fewer calories? <b>ü•£ Skyr</b> and
                            <b>ü•¢ Tofu</b> are just behind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If animal sources are where it‚Äôs at, my
                            recommendation is <b>üçó Chicken breast</b>. <br />If
                            price is not a concern and you need fewer calories,
                            go for <b>üç§ Shrimp</b>. <br />üêü <b>Salmon </b>is a
                            good alternative for shrimp if you don‚Äôt mind the
                            extra calories.<br />I would suggest eating less
                            <b>ü•© Beef steak</b> since it has a huge water
                            footprint, but it does have a nice amount of
                            protein. And finally <b>üßÄ Parmesan cheese</b>,
                            maybe add it as a topping to dishes for the extra
                            flavor and extra protein.
                        </p>

                            our first epic food tournament. Let‚Äôs go back to
                            Munich‚Ä¶
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you can see I watched a lot of
                            <b>Dragon Ball</b> growing up, which was obvious.<br />And
                            it's even more obvious I <b>think</b> a
                            <b>lot</b> about <b>food</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let‚Äôs wrap up our tournament with an
                            <b>emotional</b> <b>ending</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At any given moment, I‚Äôm thinking about food. Not
                            just imagining martial tournaments in my head every
                            time I go to a <b>supermarket</b>. It goes beyond on
                            what I will eat for dinner or if it‚Äôs time for my
                            afternoon snack. <br />I do mean
                            <b>everything, all the time</b>:<br /><br />What
                            food does for me.<br />How it tastes when I try
                            it.<br />What it means when I cook it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think about how to balance a meal.<br />I check
                            nutritional values.<br />I try to balance my macros.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think about ranking the recipes I‚Äôve cooked.<br />I
                            taste new dishes for inspiration.<br />I try new
                            ways to improve my cooking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think about how a meal should make me feel.<br />I
                            aim to pack the best snack for a hike or a long
                            train ride.<br />I try not to miss my favorite dish
                            from back home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It‚Äôs a basic necessity, and to me, it‚Äôs my way of
                            sharing how much I care for others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Food</b> should do everything. It should
                            <b>nourish</b> you, <b>taste</b> <b>good</b>, and
                            even <b>express</b> your <b>love</b> for others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I hope whatever you choose for your next meal does
                            it all.
