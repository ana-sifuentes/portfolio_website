                            I'm writing this <b>later</b> than I had hoped and
                            I’m also very tired. So this blog will be a bit
                            <b>different</b> — don’t worry, people tell me I’m
                            very funny when I’m tired. <b>Less filters</b>.

                        <p>
                            Earlier this week I <b>launched my new website</b>.
                            I finally left the comfort of the pre-made websites
                            of <b> Squarespace</b> and ventured into the wilder
                            terrain of <b>GitHub pages</b>. Wild for me —
                            <b>developers</b> should be very comfortable with
                            these waters. I’m looking at you,
                            <b>staff engineers</b> in my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My website took <b>weeks of work</b> — two weeks of
                            solid working on<b> designing </b>a new landing page
                            and porting 25+ pages — and before this, one week of
                            work doing some <b>necromancy</b> on my GitHub
                            account and oiling up my rusty
                            <b>CSS, HTML and JavaScript</b> skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Did I have to go all into the wilderness and start
                            coding again? Not really. I could have stayed in
                            Squarespace. My website seemed okay, and the content
                            management system was pretty good, but it was time
                            to move (<a href="/blog/tailor-made-website"
                                >here’s my detailed reasoning</a
                            >).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I could have also learned how to use
                            <b>Webflow</b>, but after a few hours of testing it
                            out, it wasn’t for me. It’s a good
                            <b>in-between coding and design</b>, but I used to
                            earn my bread <b>making websites</b> (<a
                                href="/work/synbio-branding"

                            >), and Webflow just seemed like it had
                            <b>too many</b> little windows and <b>settings</b>.
                            I might as well just use CSS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why did I end up redoing my website? You ask my
                            sleepy face. Short answer: it needed to be
                            perfect.<br />
                            Long answer: it needed to be <s>perfect</s> →
                            <b>better</b>. Let me elaborate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a <b>designer</b>, your <b>portfolio</b> is your
                            <b>introduction</b>. It should be close to perfect.
                            Heaven-sent. Crafted by angels pixel by pixel. Your
                            <b>work</b> and your <b>life</b>
                            <b>summarized</b> for people who are not willing to
                            spend more than 10 seconds on you. It’s
                            <b>rough</b>. You need tough skin and a lot of
                            <b>self-reflection</b>. You need to look at your
                            darling work and ask yourself: is it good enough?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My website didn’t <b>showcase</b> my<b> projects</b>
                            in the best way possible. I felt it didn’t show my<b>
                                senior level</b
                            >. Ouch. Ah, but <b>now</b> you worked for two weeks
                            and it’s <b>perfect</b>, right? Lord, no. It’s
                            better, but I had to make <b>peace</b> with the
                            “perfect” <b>enemy</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I like to pride myself as a
                            <b>very pragmatic person</b>. I love when things
                            look perfect to me, but through experience I’ve
                            learned that when you need to<b> deliver</b>, you
                            just need to have something okay for the
                            <b>deadline</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s<b> better than</b> having <b>nothing</b>. I
                            could have spent two more weeks perfecting things,
                            but if you think about it in business terms, that’s
                            two weeks you don’t have clients. Especially with
                            something fairly easy to update like my personal
                            website, it was <b>better </b>to start making
                            <b>some noise</b> <b> than silently working</b> away
                            on my magnum opus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here is my <b>4-point strategy</b> to wave the white
                            flag to “perfect” and shake hands with “good
                            enough”:

                        <p>
                            Write down what is <b>essential</b> — what has to be
                            there, absolutely no exceptions. For me it was:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A better menu (check)</li>

                            <li>
                                A good landing page that showcased star projects
                                and blog (check)
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                The website should have all my pages with the

                        <p>
                            Then I write the <b>nice-to-haves</b> and things for
                            future releases.<b> Version 2 </b>should have better
                            documentation and better images, show more of the

                            nice-to-haves make its way to the essentials?

                            Before I started porting all the pages, I had to
                            make sure<b> my structure</b> wouldn’t mean
                            <b>extra work</b> down the line. If I was moving 18
                            blog pages, I better <b> not multiply a mistake</b>.
                            I defined a good naming system that would work for
                            all images, standardized file names and locations,
                            and set the menu and footer to be loaded from
                            separate HTML files.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This way, if I needed to <b> update</b> either, I
                            just had to do it in <b> one location</b> . Spending
                            a bit of extra time thinking about where to
                            <b> avoid redundancies</b>
                            helped a lot to <b> save</b> future me precious

                            There <b>might be shortcuts</b> to what you are
                            doing. <b>Tools</b> you don’t know that can make you
                            10 times <b>faster</b>.

                            Here I want to give a special shoutout to my
                            <b>favorite engineer</b>. Instead of waiting 3+
                            minutes to see how my CSS would look once I uploaded
                            to GitHub —<i>
                                yes, I was basically using a rock to crack a
                                nut, like a crow that’s just discovering tools </i
                            >— I started using<b> Zed</b> and running my pages
                            on a <b>local host</b>. My updating speed became
                            insane. Like the <b>crow now had a gun</b>. Amazing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Do a quick search online or ask your peers what
                            tools they use to do similar projects. The<b>
                                learning curve</b
                            >
                            might be a bit <b>steep</b>, but then you will be
                            zooming downhill.<b> Like a crow</b>.(?)

                            This has nothing to do with being perfect, I'm just
                            drinking matcha right now. Yum.

                            That’s my advice! Now, if you want a
                            <b>soundtrack</b> while you work on your project and
                            it’s time to fight “perfect,” I can recommend
                            <b><i>Enemy</i></b> from <b> Imagine Dragons</b>.
                            Yes, I watched<b> Arcane</b> very recently and got
                            completely obsessed with it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Keep <b>checking your list</b> and
                            <b>revisiting your strategy</b> periodically. Things
                            can change on a day-to-day basis, but being
                            <b>pragmatic</b> will keep you <b>sane</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like Imagine Dragons say:
                            <b> <i>“Look out for yourself.”</i></b>
                            Don’t let perfect beat you.
                        </p>
