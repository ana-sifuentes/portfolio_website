                            sister today. It's fine, just sit down, grab a
                            coffee or some tea. Water is fine too. Are you
                            comfy? Let's just chat for a bit. This
                            <b>blog</b> is a bit
                            <b>different</b>; I just want to give you
                            some <b>advice</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What makes <b>me</b> your

                            <b>sister</b> today?<br />I'm probably
                            older than you think. At least I feel like I am. I
                            feel like I've lived a few lifetimes already. I am
                            both a <b>witch</b> and
                            <b>ancient</b>. We have a saying in
                            Spanish:
                            <em
                                >"El diablo sabe más por viejo que por
                                diablo."</em>
                            It translates to
                            <em>"The devil knows more because he is old, not
                                because he is a devil."</em>
                            So, <b>no</b> need to
                            <b>question</b> <b>me</b> or
                            <b>my</b> <b>advice</b>.

                            <b>wisdom</b> I've gained throughout my
                            multiple lives. This has taken me longer than I'm
                            happy to admit, but this is a very, very important
                            -and sometimes difficult to master- spell:
                            <b>when to set limits by saying 'no'.</b>

                            Have you been here before? At the

                            <b>your</b> <b>world</b> feels
                            weird. <br />Have you played
                            <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>? The
                            <b>limit</b> to me is like the northern
                            edge of the world. A <b>snowy</b>
                            <b>plain</b>, fields covered in deep snow
                            and fog. What’s beyond it? Who knows. It’s the end
                            of the map, <b>maybe</b> there is
                            <b>more</b>, <b>maybe</b> there
                            is nothing but <b>monsters</b>.

                            <b>limit</b>? How do you know that you
                            should stop pushing further? Great questions. Sadly
                            I don’t have any <b>answers</b>.
                            <b><em>You do.</em></b> You are going to
                            have to learn when to say ‘<b>No</b>’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Be not afraid. <b>I’m</b>
                            <b>not</b> <b>going</b>
                            <b>to</b> <b>leave</b>

                            Like, it’s true, but not very helpful. I’ll tell you
                            about <b>my</b> <b>travels</b>,
                            and then you can take <b>notes</b>
                            <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b>.
                            <br /><br />Does that sound okay? <br />Good, keep

                            You might have found yourself upon roads I’ve
                            already traveled a few times.

                        <p>I know
                            my<b> own limits</b>. Even in the snowy
                            plain, I can recognize the natural geography. Moss
                            growing on this side tells me
                            <em>“you can push a bit further.”</em> Certain rocks
                            indicate <em>“stop, here’s a cliff.”</em> My
                            explorer’s <b>manual</b> pages are
                            <b>well-documented</b> thanks to lots of

                            I used to get very <b>frequent</b>
                            <b>sinus</b> <b>infections</b>.
                            They happened after <b>long</b>
                            <b>periods</b> of
                            <b>stressful</b> <b>work</b>.
                            Yes, I was able to deliver: crazy deadlines, pulling
                            extra hours, endless little design changes. But then
                            came the bill. <b>Bedridden</b> for days
                            afterwards. It happened enough times that I
                            <b>memorized</b> the
                            <b>pattern</b>:
                            <em>Overdo it, and you better stock up on
                                Mucinex.</em>
                            Nowadays, when I feel the <b>first</b>
                            <b>sign</b> of <b>sinus</b>
                            <b>pressure</b>, it’s time to
                            <b>rest</b>.

                        <p>
                            A non-work-related example? Let’s get a bit messy.
                            <br /><br />I’ve been in some
                            <b><em>not-great</em> relationships</b>,
                            to put it mildly. The worst ones ended when,
                            finally, my <b>survival</b>
                            <b>instinct</b> kicked in. I realized,
                            almost too late, that I was a <b>step</b>
                            <b>away</b> from a
                            <b>precipice</b>. Now, the
                            <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> that
                            something is crossing the border into dangerous
                            territory are <b>super</b>
                            <b>clear</b>:
                            <em>Do you want to run away and start your life in
                                a new city? Are you crying every day on your way
                                to work? Does this person make you feel like you
                                are less?</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was <b>rough</b>. I was in a
                            <b>dark</b> <b>place</b>. But
                            something in me said <b><em>no</em>That’s enough. Get out of my house.
                            Get out of my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bottom line: <b>Listen</b>
                            <b>to</b> <b>your</b>
                            <b>body</b>. Your gut knows. Something
                            feels <b>a bit off</b>? You can
                            <b>try pushing</b> a bit more, but with
                            caution. If that <em>something</em> feels
                            <b>really</b> <b>off</b>?
                            <b>Stop</b>.

                            The relationships I alluded to before were pretty
                            extreme, but the <b>knowledge</b> I
                            <b>gained</b> there has become
                            <b>very</b> <b>useful</b>. You
                            get so good at <b>recognizing</b> the
                            <b>signs</b> of your own limit that you
                            don’t take a step in that direction anymore. For
                            example, I was in what some would consider a
                            <b>good</b> and healthy
                            <b>connection</b>,
                            <b>basically</b>
                            <b>perfect</b> on paper. <br />But it
                            <b>wasn’t</b> <b>for</b>
                            <b>me</b>. I had to say no.

                            During a meal at a restaurant, the room felt
                            oppressive to me. The sounds were too loud, the
                            conversation felt flat, the food unsavory.
                            <b>Something</b> <b>was</b>
                            <b>off</b>. I looked towards the
                            <b>horizon</b> and knew that down the
                            road, it would <b>only</b> be restaurants
                            <b>like</b> <b>this</b>. <br />I
                            <b>meditated</b> on this
                            <b>decision</b> for a few days, and every
                            time I thought about it, I felt it it in my stomach.
