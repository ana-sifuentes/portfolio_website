hi there

i was walking down memory lane the other day - in my head, i was actually working at a coffee show -
and as i finishing cleaning up some project documentation and i ended up remembering something.


back in one of my previous lives,
when i used to work for the igem foundation
and was responsable for mainting websites,
i taught myself how to code.

i wouldnt call myself an engineer, if anythig just a very technical designer
but i used to design and implement websites
and the more i did it, the more i wanted to do it,
i started with html and css and ended learning javascript and jquery.
