hi there

i was walking down memory lane the other day - in my head, i was actually working at a coffee show -
and as i finishing cleaning up some project documentation and i ended up remembering something.


back in one of my previous lives,
when i used to work for the igem foundation
and was responsable for mainting websites,
i had to teach myself how to code.

while i wouldnt call myself an engineer, i do consider myself a very technical designer
and i am pretty used to designing and implementing websites.
once i started creating them i got hooked.  the more i did it, the more i wanted to do it,
i started with html and css and ended learning javascript and jquery.


redoing my portfolio website has awaken that coding itch again
and while i keep polishing my front-end skills i wanted to go back and check a litte
project i did a few years ago. ready to look into some old javascript?


let's review this through a STAR lense
meaning -> situation, task, actions and results

pro tip: this is a super useful structure whenever you are talking about your projects
during interviews - ask a PM friend for help :)


1) situation
In 2020 a lot of things had to suddenly become remote


2) tasks

as the designer i was in charge of the website
we already uploaded all information here so everything was already centralized and i was
very familiar with the code
